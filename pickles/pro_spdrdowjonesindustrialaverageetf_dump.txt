SUMMARY 
Investment Objective 
The Trust seeks to provide investment results that, before expenses, correspond 
generally to the price and yield performance of the Dow Jones Industrial Average 
(the “DJIA”). Fees and Expenses of the Trust 
This table estimates the fees and expenses that the Trust pays on an annual basis, 
which you therefore pay indirectly when you buy and hold Units. It does not reflect 
brokerage commissions and other fees to financial intermediaries that you may pay 
for purchases and sales of Units on the secondary markets. Unitholder Fees: None 
(fees paid directly from your investment) 
 
Estimated Annual Trust Ordinary Operating Expenses:

The Trust’s Investments and Portfolio Turnover 
The Trust seeks to achieve its investment objective by holding a portfolio of the 
common stocks that are included in the DJIA (the “Portfolio”), with the weight of 
each stock in the Portfolio substantially corresponding to the weight of such stock in 
the DJIA. In this prospectus, the term “Portfolio Securities” refers to the common stocks that 
are actually held by the Trust and make up the Trust’s Portfolio, while the term 
“Index Securities” refers to the common stocks that are included in the DJIA, as 
determined by the index provider, S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC (“S&P”). At any 
time, the Portfolio will consist of as many of the Index Securities as is practicable. To 
maintain the correspondence between the composition and weightings of Portfolio 
Securities and Index Securities, State Street Global Advisors Trust Company, the 
trustee of the Trust (the “Trustee”), or its parent company, State Street Bank and 
Trust Company (“SSBT”), adjusts the Portfolio from time to time to conform to 
periodic changes made by S&P to the identity and/or relative weightings of Index 
Securities in the DJIA. The Trustee or SSBT generally makes these adjustments to 
the Portfolio within three (3) Business Days (as defined below in “Purchases and 
Redemptions of Creation Units — Purchase (Creation)”) before or after the day on 
which changes in the DJIA are scheduled to take effect. The Trust may pay transaction costs, such as brokerage commissions, when it buys 
and sells securities (or “turns over” its Portfolio).

The Trustee or SSBT generally makes these adjustments to 
the Portfolio within three (3) Business Days (as defined below in “Purchases and 
Redemptions of Creation Units — Purchase (Creation)”) before or after the day on 
which changes in the DJIA are scheduled to take effect. The Trust may pay transaction costs, such as brokerage commissions, when it buys 
and sells securities (or “turns over” its Portfolio). Such transaction costs may be 
higher if there are significant rebalancings of Index Securities in the Index, which 
may also result in higher taxes when Units are held in a taxable account. These costs, 
which are not reflected in estimated annual Trust ordinary operating expenses, affect 
the Trust’s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Trust’s portfolio 
turnover rate was 3% of the average value of its portfolio. The Trust’s portfolio 
turnover rate does not include securities received or delivered from processing 
creations or redemptions of Units. Portfolio turnover will be a function of changes to 
the DJIA as well as requirements of the Trust Agreement (as defined below in 
“Organization of the Trust”). Although the Trust may fail to own certain Index Securities at any particular time, the 
Trust generally will be substantially invested in Index Securities, which should result 
in a close correspondence between the performance of the DJIA and the performance 
of the Trust. See “The DJIA” below for more information regarding the DJIA. The 
Trust does not hold or trade futures or swaps and is not a commodity pool. Dividends 
Payments of dividends are made monthly, on the Monday preceding the third 
(3rd) Friday of the next calendar month. See “Dividends and Distributions” and 
“Additional Information Regarding Dividends and Distributions.”

Payments of dividends are made monthly, on the Monday preceding the third

“Additional Information Regarding Dividends and Distributions.” 2 
Redemption of Units 
Only certain institutional investors (typically market makers or other broker-dealers) 
are permitted to purchase or redeem Units directly with the Trust, and they may do so 
only in large blocks of 50,000 Units known as “Creation Units.” See “Purchases and 
Redemptions of Creation Units — Redemption” and “Trust Agreement” for more 
information regarding the rights of Beneficial Owners (as defined in “Book-Entry-
Only System”). Voting Rights; Book-Entry-Only System 
Beneficial Owners shall not have the right to vote concerning the Trust, except with 
respect to termination and as otherwise expressly set forth in the Trust Agreement. See “Trust Agreement.” Units are represented by one or more global securities 
registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee for The Depository 
Trust Company (“DTC”), and deposited with, or on behalf of, DTC. See “Book-
Entry-Only System.” Amendments to the Trust Agreement 
The Trust Agreement (as defined below in “Organization of the Trust”) may be 
amended from time to time by the Trustee and PDR Services, LLC (the “Sponsor”) 
without the consent of any Beneficial Owners under certain circumstances described 
herein. The Trust Agreement may also be amended by the Sponsor and the Trustee 
with the consent of the Beneficial Owners to modify the rights of Beneficial Owners 
under certain circumstances. Promptly after the execution of an amendment to the 
Trust Agreement, the Trustee arranges for written notice to be provided to Beneficial 
Owners. See “Trust Agreement — Amendments to the Trust Agreement.” Principal Risks of Investing in the Trust As with all investments, there are certain risks of investing in the Trust, and you 
could lose money on an investment in the Trust.

Principal Risks of Investing in the Trust As with all investments, there are certain risks of investing in the Trust, and you 
could lose money on an investment in the Trust. Prospective investors should 
carefully consider the risk factors described below, as well as the additional risk 
factors under “Additional Risk Information” and the other information included in 
this prospectus, before deciding to invest in Units. Passive Strategy/Index Risk. The Trust is not actively managed. Rather, the Trust 
attempts to track the performance of an unmanaged index of securities. This differs 
from an actively managed fund, which typically seeks to outperform a benchmark 
index. As a result, the Trust will hold constituent securities of the DJIA regardless of 
the current or projected performance of a specific security or a particular industry or 
market sector. Maintaining investments in securities regardless of market conditions 
or the performance of individual securities could cause the Trust’s return to be lower 
than if the Trust employed an active strategy. 3 
Index Tracking Risk. While the Trust is intended to track the performance of the 
DJIA as closely as possible (i.e., to achieve a high degree of correlation with the 
DJIA), the Trust’s return may not match or achieve a high degree of correlation with 
the return of the DJIA due to expenses and transaction costs incurred in adjusting the 
Portfolio. In addition, it is possible that the Trust may not always fully replicate the 
performance of the DJIA due to the unavailability of certain Index Securities in the 
secondary market or due to other extraordinary circumstances (e.g., if trading in a 
security has been halted). In addition, the Trust’s portfolio may deviate from the 
DJIA to the extent required to ensure continued qualification as a “regulated 
investment company” under Subchapter M of the Code. Equity Investing and Market Risk.

In addition, the Trust’s portfolio may deviate from the 
DJIA to the extent required to ensure continued qualification as a “regulated 
investment company” under Subchapter M of the Code. Equity Investing and Market Risk. An investment in the Trust involves risks similar 
to those of investing in any fund of equity securities, such as market fluctuations 
caused by such factors as economic and political developments, changes in interest 
rates, perceived trends in securities prices, war, acts of terrorism, the spread of 
infectious disease or other public health issues. Local, regional or global events such 
as war, acts of terrorism, the spread of infectious disease or other public health issues, 
recessions, or other events could have a significant impact on the Trust and its 
investments and could result in increased premiums or discounts to the Trust’s net 
asset value. For example, conflict, loss of life and disaster connected to ongoing 
armed conflicts between Ukraine and Russia in Europe and Israel and Hamas in the 
Middle East could have severe adverse effects on their respective regions, including 
significant adverse effects on the regional or global economies and markets for 
certain securities. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has resulted in sanctions against 
Russian governmental institutions, Russian entities, and Russian individuals that may 
result in the devaluation of Russian currency; a downgrade in the country’s credit 
rating; a freeze of Russian foreign assets; and a decline in the value and liquidity of 
Russian securities, properties, or interests.

Russian governmental institutions, Russian entities, and Russian individuals that may 
result in the devaluation of Russian currency; a downgrade in the country’s credit 
rating; a freeze of Russian foreign assets; and a decline in the value and liquidity of 
Russian securities, properties, or interests. These Russian-related sanctions as well as 
the potential for military escalation and other corresponding events in Europe and the 
Middle East, and the resulting disruption of the Russian and Israeli economies, may 
cause volatility in other regional and global markets and may negatively impact the 
performance of various sectors and industries, as well as companies in other 
countries, which could have a negative effect on the performance of the Trust, even if 
the Trust does not have direct exposure to securities of Russian and Israeli issuers. An investment in the Trust is subject to the risks of any investment in a portfolio of 
large-capitalization common stocks, including the risk that the general level of stock 
prices may decline, thereby adversely affecting the value of such investment. The 
value of Portfolio Securities may fluctuate in accordance with changes in the 
financial condition of the issuers of Portfolio Securities, the value of common stocks 
generally and other factors. The identity and weighting of Index Securities and the 
Portfolio Securities change from time to time.

The 
value of Portfolio Securities may fluctuate in accordance with changes in the 
financial condition of the issuers of Portfolio Securities, the value of common stocks 
generally and other factors. The identity and weighting of Index Securities and the 
Portfolio Securities change from time to time. The financial condition of issuers of Portfolio Securities may become impaired or the 
general condition of the stock market may deteriorate, either of which may cause a 
decrease in the value of the Portfolio and thus in the value of Units. Since the Trust is 
4 
not actively managed, the adverse financial condition of an issuer will not result in its 
elimination from the Portfolio unless such issuer is removed from the DJIA. Equity 
securities are susceptible to general stock market fluctuations and to volatile 
increases and decreases in value as market confidence in and perceptions of their 
issuers change. These investor perceptions are based on various and unpredictable 
factors, including expectations regarding government, economic, monetary and fiscal 
policies, inflation and interest rates, economic expansion or contraction, and global or 
regional political, economic and banking crises, as well as war, acts of terrorism and 
the spread of infectious disease or other public health issues. The impact of infectious disease outbreaks that may arise in the future, could 
adversely affect the economies of many nations or the entire global economy, 
individual issuers and capital markets in ways that cannot necessarily be foreseen. Public health crises may exacerbate other pre-existing political, social and economic 
risks in certain countries or globally. These factors, as well as any restrictive 
measures instituted in order to prevent or control a pandemic or other public health 
crisis could have a material and adverse effect on the Trust’s investments.

Public health crises may exacerbate other pre-existing political, social and economic 
risks in certain countries or globally. These factors, as well as any restrictive 
measures instituted in order to prevent or control a pandemic or other public health 
crisis could have a material and adverse effect on the Trust’s investments. Holders of common stocks of any given issuer incur more risk than holders of 
preferred stocks and debt obligations of the issuer because the rights of common 
stockholders, as owners of the issuer, generally are subordinate to the rights of 
creditors of, or holders of debt obligations or preferred stocks issued by, such issuer. Further, unlike debt securities that typically have a stated principal amount payable at 
maturity, or preferred stocks that typically have a liquidation preference and may 
have stated optional or mandatory redemption provisions, common stocks have 
neither a fixed principal amount nor a maturity. Equity securities values are subject to 
market fluctuations as long as the equity securities remain outstanding. The value of 
the Portfolio will fluctuate over the entire life of the Trust. The Trust may have significant investments in one or more specific industries or 
sectors, subjecting it to risks greater than general market risk. The Trust may invest a larger percentage of its assets in the securities of a few 
issuers. As a result, the Trust’s performance may be disproportionately impacted by 
the performance of relatively few securities. There can be no assurance that the issuers of Portfolio Securities will pay dividends. Distributions generally depend upon the declaration of dividends by the issuers of 
Portfolio Securities, and the declaration of such dividends generally depends upon 
various factors, including the financial condition of the issuers and general economic 
conditions. Trust Performance

compares with the average annual return of the DJIA. The Trust’s past performance 
(before and after taxes) is not necessarily an indication of how the Trust will perform 
in the future. Updated performance information is available online at 
http://www.spdrs.com. The total returns in the bar chart, as well as the total and after-tax returns presented in

Units are also listed and

Euronext Amsterdam (ticker symbol DIA). In the future, Units may be listed and 
traded on other non-U.S. exchanges. Units may be purchased on other trading 
markets or venues in addition to the Exchange, the Singapore Exchange Securities 
Trading Limited and Euronext Amsterdam. Euronext Amsterdam is an indirect 
wholly owned subsidiary of NYSE Holdings LLC. Only certain institutional investors (typically market makers or other broker-dealers) 
are permitted to purchase or redeem Units directly with the Trust, and they may do so 
only in large blocks of 50,000 Units known as “Creation Units.” Creation Unit 
transactions are conducted in exchange for the deposit or delivery of in-kind 
securities and/or cash constituting a substantial replication of the securities included 
in the DJIA. TAX INFORMATION The Trust will make distributions that are expected to be taxable currently to you as 
ordinary income and/or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-deferred 
arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or individual retirement account. See “Federal 
Income Taxes,” below, for more information. THE DJIA The DJIA was first published in 1896. Initially composed of 12 companies, the DJIA 
has evolved into the most recognizable stock indicator in the world, and the only 
index composed of companies that have sustained earnings performance over a 
significant period of time. In its second century, the DJIA is the oldest continuous 
barometer of the U.S. stock market, and the most widely quoted indicator of 
U.S. stock market activity. 7

SUMMARY 
Investment Objective 
The Trust seeks to provide investment results that, before expenses, correspond 
generally to the price and yield performance of the Dow Jones Industrial Average 
(the “DJIA”). Fees and Expenses of the Trust 
This table estimates the fees and expenses that the Trust pays on an annual basis, 
which you therefore pay indirectly when you buy and hold Units. It does not reflect 
brokerage commissions and other fees to financial intermediaries that you may pay 
for purchases and sales of Units on the secondary markets. Unitholder Fees: None 
(fees paid directly from your investment) 
 
Estimated Annual Trust Ordinary Operating Expenses: 
(expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment) Current Estimated Annual Trust Ordinary Operating Expenses

DJIA License Fee 
0.04% 
Marketing

The Trust’s Investments and Portfolio Turnover 
The Trust seeks to achieve its investment objective by holding a portfolio of the 
common stocks that are included in the DJIA (the “Portfolio”), with the weight of 
each stock in the Portfolio substantially corresponding to the weight of such stock in 
the DJIA. In this prospectus, the term “Portfolio Securities” refers to the common stocks that 
are actually held by the Trust and make up the Trust’s Portfolio, while the term 
“Index Securities” refers to the common stocks that are included in the DJIA, as 
determined by the index provider, S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC (“S&P”). At any 
time, the Portfolio will consist of as many of the Index Securities as is practicable. To 
maintain the correspondence between the composition and weightings of Portfolio 
Securities and Index Securities, State Street Global Advisors Trust Company, the 
trustee of the Trust (the “Trustee”), or its parent company, State Street Bank and 
Trust Company (“SSBT”), adjusts the Portfolio from time to time to conform to 
periodic changes made by S&P to the identity and/or relative weightings of Index 
Securities in the DJIA. The Trustee or SSBT generally makes these adjustments to 
the Portfolio within three (3) Business Days (as defined below in “Purchases and 
Redemptions of Creation Units — Purchase (Creation)”) before or after the day on 
which changes in the DJIA are scheduled to take effect. The Trust may pay transaction costs, such as brokerage commissions, when it buys 
and sells securities (or “turns over” its Portfolio). Such transaction costs may be 
higher if there are significant rebalancings of Index Securities in the Index, which 
may also result in higher taxes when Units are held in a taxable account. These costs, 
which are not reflected in estimated annual Trust ordinary operating expenses, affect 
the Trust’s performance.

Trust generally will be substantially invested in Index Securities, which should result

of the Trust. See “The DJIA” below for more information regarding the DJIA. The 
Trust does not hold or trade futures or swaps and is not a commodity pool. Dividends 
Payments of dividends are made monthly, on the Monday preceding the third 
(3rd) Friday of the next calendar month. See “Dividends and Distributions” and

Redemption of Units 
Only certain institutional investors (typically market makers or other broker-dealers) 
are permitted to purchase or redeem Units directly with the Trust, and they may do so 
only in large blocks of 50,000 Units known as “Creation Units.” See “Purchases and 
Redemptions of Creation Units — Redemption” and “Trust Agreement” for more 
information regarding the rights of Beneficial Owners (as defined in “Book-Entry-
Only System”). Voting Rights; Book-Entry-Only System 
Beneficial Owners shall not have the right to vote concerning the Trust, except with 
respect to termination and as otherwise expressly set forth in the Trust Agreement. See “Trust Agreement.” Units are represented by one or more global securities 
registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee for The Depository 
Trust Company (“DTC”), and deposited with, or on behalf of, DTC. See “Book-
Entry-Only System.” Amendments to the Trust Agreement 
The Trust Agreement (as defined below in “Organization of the Trust”) may be 
amended from time to time by the Trustee and PDR Services, LLC (the “Sponsor”) 
without the consent of any Beneficial Owners under certain circumstances described 
herein. The Trust Agreement may also be amended by the Sponsor and the Trustee 
with the consent of the Beneficial Owners to modify the rights of Beneficial Owners 
under certain circumstances. Promptly after the execution of an amendment to the 
Trust Agreement, the Trustee arranges for written notice to be provided to Beneficial 
Owners. See “Trust Agreement — Amendments to the Trust Agreement.” Principal Risks of Investing in the Trust As with all investments, there are certain risks of investing in the Trust, and you 
could lose money on an investment in the Trust. Prospective investors should

attempts to track the performance of an unmanaged index of securities. This differs 
from an actively managed fund, which typically seeks to outperform a benchmark 
index. As a result, the Trust will hold constituent securities of the DJIA regardless of 
the current or projected performance of a specific security or a particular industry or 
market sector. Maintaining investments in securities regardless of market conditions 
or the performance of individual securities could cause the Trust’s return to be lower 
than if the Trust employed an active strategy. 3

Index Tracking Risk. While the Trust is intended to track the performance of the 
DJIA as closely as possible (i.e., to achieve a high degree of correlation with the 
DJIA), the Trust’s return may not match or achieve a high degree of correlation with 
the return of the DJIA due to expenses and transaction costs incurred in adjusting the 
Portfolio. In addition, it is possible that the Trust may not always fully replicate the 
performance of the DJIA due to the unavailability of certain Index Securities in the 
secondary market or due to other extraordinary circumstances (e.g., if trading in a 
security has been halted). In addition, the Trust’s portfolio may deviate from the 
DJIA to the extent required to ensure continued qualification as a “regulated 
investment company” under Subchapter M of the Code. Equity Investing and Market Risk.

In addition, the Trust’s portfolio may deviate from the 
DJIA to the extent required to ensure continued qualification as a “regulated 
investment company” under Subchapter M of the Code. Equity Investing and Market Risk. An investment in the Trust involves risks similar 
to those of investing in any fund of equity securities, such as market fluctuations 
caused by such factors as economic and political developments, changes in interest 
rates, perceived trends in securities prices, war, acts of terrorism, the spread of 
infectious disease or other public health issues. Local, regional or global events such 
as war, acts of terrorism, the spread of infectious disease or other public health issues, 
recessions, or other events could have a significant impact on the Trust and its 
investments and could result in increased premiums or discounts to the Trust’s net 
asset value. For example, conflict, loss of life and disaster connected to ongoing 
armed conflicts between Ukraine and Russia in Europe and Israel and Hamas in the 
Middle East could have severe adverse effects on their respective regions, including 
significant adverse effects on the regional or global economies and markets for 
certain securities. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has resulted in sanctions against 
Russian governmental institutions, Russian entities, and Russian individuals that may 
result in the devaluation of Russian currency; a downgrade in the country’s credit 
rating; a freeze of Russian foreign assets; and a decline in the value and liquidity of 
Russian securities, properties, or interests.

the potential for military escalation and other corresponding events in Europe and the 
Middle East, and the resulting disruption of the Russian and Israeli economies, may 
cause volatility in other regional and global markets and may negatively impact the 
performance of various sectors and industries, as well as companies in other 
countries, which could have a negative effect on the performance of the Trust, even if 
the Trust does not have direct exposure to securities of Russian and Israeli issuers. An investment in the Trust is subject to the risks of any investment in a portfolio of 
large-capitalization common stocks, including the risk that the general level of stock 
prices may decline, thereby adversely affecting the value of such investment. The 
value of Portfolio Securities may fluctuate in accordance with changes in the 
financial condition of the issuers of Portfolio Securities, the value of common stocks 
generally and other factors. The identity and weighting of Index Securities and the 
Portfolio Securities change from time to time.

The

generally and other factors. The identity and weighting of Index Securities and the 
Portfolio Securities change from time to time. The financial condition of issuers of Portfolio Securities may become impaired or the 
general condition of the stock market may deteriorate, either of which may cause a 
decrease in the value of the Portfolio and thus in the value of Units. Since the Trust is 
4 
not actively managed, the adverse financial condition of an issuer will not result in its 
elimination from the Portfolio unless such issuer is removed from the DJIA. Equity 
securities are susceptible to general stock market fluctuations and to volatile 
increases and decreases in value as market confidence in and perceptions of their 
issuers change. These investor perceptions are based on various and unpredictable 
factors, including expectations regarding government, economic, monetary and fiscal 
policies, inflation and interest rates, economic expansion or contraction, and global or 
regional political, economic and banking crises, as well as war, acts of terrorism and 
the spread of infectious disease or other public health issues. The impact of infectious disease outbreaks that may arise in the future, could 
adversely affect the economies of many nations or the entire global economy, 
individual issuers and capital markets in ways that cannot necessarily be foreseen. Public health crises may exacerbate other pre-existing political, social and economic 
risks in certain countries or globally. These factors, as well as any restrictive 
measures instituted in order to prevent or control a pandemic or other public health 
crisis could have a material and adverse effect on the Trust’s investments.

Public health crises may exacerbate other pre-existing political, social and economic 
risks in certain countries or globally. These factors, as well as any restrictive 
measures instituted in order to prevent or control a pandemic or other public health 
crisis could have a material and adverse effect on the Trust’s investments. Holders of common stocks of any given issuer incur more risk than holders of 
preferred stocks and debt obligations of the issuer because the rights of common 
stockholders, as owners of the issuer, generally are subordinate to the rights of 
creditors of, or holders of debt obligations or preferred stocks issued by, such issuer. Further, unlike debt securities that typically have a stated principal amount payable at 
maturity, or preferred stocks that typically have a liquidation preference and may 
have stated optional or mandatory redemption provisions, common stocks have 
neither a fixed principal amount nor a maturity. Equity securities values are subject to 
market fluctuations as long as the equity securities remain outstanding. The value of 
the Portfolio will fluctuate over the entire life of the Trust. The Trust may have significant investments in one or more specific industries or 
sectors, subjecting it to risks greater than general market risk. The Trust may invest a larger percentage of its assets in the securities of a few 
issuers. As a result, the Trust’s performance may be disproportionately impacted by 
the performance of relatively few securities. There can be no assurance that the issuers of Portfolio Securities will pay dividends. Distributions generally depend upon the declaration of dividends by the issuers of 
Portfolio Securities, and the declaration of such dividends generally depends upon 
various factors, including the financial condition of the issuers and general economic 
conditions. Trust Performance

ordinary income and/or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-deferred 
arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or individual retirement account. See “Federal 
Income Taxes,” below, for more information. THE DJIA The DJIA was first published in 1896. Initially composed of 12 companies, the DJIA 
has evolved into the most recognizable stock indicator in the world, and the only 
index composed of companies that have sustained earnings performance over a 
significant period of time. In its second century, the DJIA is the oldest continuous 
barometer of the U.S. stock market, and the most widely quoted indicator of 
U.S. stock market activity. 7

U.S. stock market activity. 7 The companies represented by the 30 stocks now composing the DJIA are all leaders 
in their respective industries, and their stocks are widely held by individuals and 
institutional investors. S&P is not responsible for and does not participate in the creation or sale of Units or 
in the determination of the timing, pricing, or quantities and proportions of purchases 
or sales of Index Securities or Portfolio Securities by the Trust. The information in 
this prospectus concerning S&P and the DJIA has been obtained from sources that 
the Sponsor believes to be reliable, but the Sponsor takes no responsibility for the 
accuracy of such information. The following table shows the actual performance of the DJIA for the years 1896 
through 2024. The results shown should not be considered representative of the

Reflects no deduction for fees, expenses or taxes. The DJIA is a price-weighted stock index, meaning that the component stocks of the 
DJIA are accorded relative importance based on their prices. In this regard, the DJIA 
is unlike many other stock indexes which weight their component stocks by market 
capitalization (price times shares outstanding). The DJIA is called an “average” 
because originally it was calculated by adding up the component stock prices and 
then dividing by the number of stocks. The method remains the same today, but the 
number of significant digits in the divisor (the number that is divided into the total of 
the stock prices) has been increased to eight significant digits to minimize distortions 
due to rounding and has been adjusted over time to ensure continuity of the DJIA 
after component stock changes and corporate actions, as discussed below. The DJIA divisor is adjusted due to corporate actions that change the price of any of 
its component shares. The most frequent reason for such an adjustment is a stock 
split. For example, suppose a company in the DJIA issues one new share for each 
share outstanding. After this two-for-one “split,” each share of stock is worth half 
what it was immediately before, other things being equal. But without an adjustment 
in the divisor, this split would produce a distortion in the DJIA. An adjustment must 
be made to compensate so that the “average” will remain unchanged. At S&P, this 
adjustment is handled by changing the divisor.* The formula used to calculate divisor 
adjustments is: 
New Divisor =  Current Divisor x Adjusted Sum of Prices 
 
 
Unadjusted Sum of Prices 
* 
Currently, the divisor is adjusted after the close of business on the day prior to 
the occurrence of the split; the divisor is not adjusted for regular cash dividends. 11

managing editor of The Wall Street Journal, the head of Dow Jones Indexes research 
and the head of CME Group research. Additions or deletions of components may be 
made to achieve better representation of the broad market and of American industry. In selecting components for the DJIA, the following criteria are used: (a) the 
company is not a utility or in the transportation business; (b) the company has a 
premier reputation in its field; (c) the company has a history of successful growth; 
and (d) there is wide interest among individual and institutional investors. Whenever 
one component is changed, the others are reviewed. For the sake of historical 
continuity, composition changes are made rarely. DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS 
Dividends and Capital Gains 
Holders of Units receive each calendar month an amount corresponding to the 
amount of any cash dividends declared on the Portfolio Securities during the 
applicable period, net of fees and expenses associated with operation of the Trust, 
and taxes, if applicable. Because of such fees and expenses, the dividend yield for 
Units is ordinarily less than that of the DJIA. Although all such distributions are 
currently made monthly, under certain limited circumstances the Trustee may vary 
the times at which such distributions are made. Any capital gain income recognized by the Trust in any taxable year that is not 
distributed during the year ordinarily is distributed at least annually in January of the 
following taxable year.

Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). The amount of distributions may vary significantly from period to period. Under 
certain limited circumstances, special dividend payments also may be made to 
holders of Units. See “Additional Information Regarding Dividends and 
Distributions.” Investors should consult their tax advisors regarding tax consequences 
associated with Trust dividends, as well as those associated with Unit sales or 
redemptions. No Dividend Reinvestment Service No dividend reinvestment service is provided by the Trust. Broker-dealers, at their 
own discretion, may offer a dividend reinvestment service under which additional 
Units are purchased in the secondary market at current market prices. Investors 
should consult their broker-dealer for further information regarding any dividend 
reinvestment program offered by such broker-dealer. 
Distributions in cash that are reinvested in additional Units through a dividend 
reinvestment service, if offered by an investor’s broker-dealer, will be taxable 
dividends to the same extent as if such dividends had been received in cash. 12

The DJIA is maintained by the Averages Committee, which is composed of the 
managing editor of The Wall Street Journal, the head of Dow Jones Indexes research 
and the head of CME Group research. Additions or deletions of components may be 
made to achieve better representation of the broad market and of American industry. In selecting components for the DJIA, the following criteria are used: (a) the 
company is not a utility or in the transportation business; (b) the company has a 
premier reputation in its field; (c) the company has a history of successful growth; 
and (d) there is wide interest among individual and institutional investors. Whenever 
one component is changed, the others are reviewed. For the sake of historical 
continuity, composition changes are made rarely. DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS 
Dividends and Capital Gains 
Holders of Units receive each calendar month an amount corresponding to the 
amount of any cash dividends declared on the Portfolio Securities during the 
applicable period, net of fees and expenses associated with operation of the Trust, 
and taxes, if applicable. Because of such fees and expenses, the dividend yield for 
Units is ordinarily less than that of the DJIA. Although all such distributions are 
currently made monthly, under certain limited circumstances the Trustee may vary 
the times at which such distributions are made. Any capital gain income recognized by the Trust in any taxable year that is not 
distributed during the year ordinarily is distributed at least annually in January of the 
following taxable year. The Trust may make additional distributions shortly after the 
end of the year in order to satisfy certain distribution requirements imposed by the 
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). The amount of distributions may vary significantly from period to period. Under 
certain limited circumstances, special dividend payments also may be made to 
holders of Units.

FEDERAL INCOME TAXES 
The following is a description of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences 
of owning and disposing of Units. The discussion below provides general tax 
information relating to an investment in Units, but it does not purport to be a 
comprehensive description of all the U.S. federal income tax considerations that may 
be relevant to a particular person’s decision to invest in Units. This discussion does 
not describe all of the tax consequences that may be relevant in light of the particular 
circumstances of a beneficial owner of Units, including alternative minimum tax 
consequences, Medicare contribution tax consequences and tax consequences 
applicable to beneficial owners subject to special rules, such as: 
• certain financial institutions; 
• regulated investment companies; 
• real estate investment trusts; 
• dealers or traders in securities that use a mark-to-market method of tax 
accounting; 
• persons subject to special accounting rules under Section 451(b) of the Code; 
• persons holding Units as part of a hedging transaction, straddle, wash sale, 
conversion transaction or integrated transaction or persons entering into a 
constructive sale with respect to the Units; 
• U.S. Holders (as defined below) whose functional currency for U.S. federal 
income tax purposes is not the U.S. dollar; 
• entities classified as partnerships or otherwise treated as pass-through entities 
for U.S. federal income tax purposes; 
• certain former U.S. citizens and residents and expatriated entities; 
• tax-exempt entities, including an “individual retirement account” or “Roth 
IRA”; or 
• insurance companies. If an entity that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes 
holds Units, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner will generally depend 
on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership.

Partnerships holding 
Units and partners in such partnerships should consult their tax advisors as to the 
particular U.S. federal income tax consequences of holding and disposing of the 
Units in light of their specific circumstances. The following discussion applies only to an owner of Units that (i) is treated as the 
beneficial owner of such Units for U.S. federal income tax purposes and (ii) holds 
such Units as capital assets. This discussion is based on the Code, administrative pronouncements, judicial 
decisions, and final, temporary and proposed Treasury regulations all as of the date 
hereof, any of which is subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. 13 
Prospective purchasers of Units are urged to consult their tax advisors with regard to 
the application of the U.S. federal income and estate tax laws to their particular 
situations, as well as any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local 
or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction. Taxation of the Trust 
The Trust believes that it qualified as a regulated investment company under 
Subchapter M of the Code (a “RIC”) for its taxable year ended October 31, 2024 and 
intends to qualify as a RIC in the current and future taxable years. Assuming that the 
Trust so qualifies and that it satisfies the distribution requirements described below, 
the Trust generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on income 
distributed in a timely manner to the holders of its Units (“Unitholders”). To qualify as a RIC for any taxable year, the Trust must, among other things, satisfy 
both an income test and an asset diversification test for such taxable year.

Trust’s share of income derived from a partnership other than a “qualified publicly 
traded partnership” will be treated as Qualifying RIC Income only to the extent that 
such income would have constituted Qualifying RIC Income if derived directly by 
the Trust. In order to be exempt from U.S. federal income tax on its distributed income, the 
Trust must distribute to its Unitholders on a timely basis at least 90% of the sum of 
(i) its “investment company taxable income” (determined prior to the deduction for 
14 
dividends paid by the Trust) and (ii) its net tax-exempt interest income for each 
taxable year. In general, a RIC’s “investment company taxable income” for any 
taxable year is its taxable income, determined without regard to net capital gain (that 
is, the excess of net long-term capital gains over net short-term capital losses) and 
with certain other adjustments. Any taxable income, including any net capital gain, 
that the Trust does not distribute to its Unitholders in a timely manner will be subject 
to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates. A RIC will be subject to a nondeductible 4% excise tax on certain amounts that it 
fails to distribute during each calendar year.

to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates. A RIC will be subject to a nondeductible 4% excise tax on certain amounts that it 
fails to distribute during each calendar year. In order to avoid this excise tax, a RIC 
must distribute during each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of 
(i) 98% of its ordinary taxable income for the calendar year, (ii) 98.2% of its capital 
gain net income for the one-year period ended on October 31 of the calendar year and 
(iii) any ordinary income and capital gains for previous years that were not 
distributed during those years. For purposes of determining whether the Trust has met 
this distribution requirement, (i) certain ordinary gains and losses that would 
otherwise be taken into account for the portion of the calendar year after October 31 
will be treated as arising on January 1 of the following calendar year and (ii) the 
Trust will be deemed to have distributed any income or gains on which it has paid 
U.S. federal income tax. If the Trust failed to qualify as a RIC or failed to satisfy the 90% distribution 
requirement in any taxable year, the Trust would be subject to U.S. federal income 
tax at regular corporate rates on its taxable income, including its net capital gain, 
even if such income were distributed to its Unitholders, and all distributions out of 
earnings and profits would be taxable as dividend income. Such distributions 
generally would be eligible for the dividends-received deduction in the case of 
corporate U.S. Holders (defined below) and would constitute “qualified dividend 
income” for individual U.S. Holders. See “Federal Income Taxes — Tax

Consequences to U.S. Holders — Distributions.” In addition, the Trust could be 
required to recognize unrealized gains, pay taxes and make distributions (which 
could be subject to interest charges) before requalifying for taxation as a RIC. If the 
Trust fails to satisfy the income test or diversification test described above, however, 
it may be able to avoid losing its status as a RIC by timely curing such failure, paying 
a tax and/or providing notice of such failure to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the 
“IRS”). In order to meet the distribution requirements necessary to be exempt from U.S. 
federal income and excise tax, the Trust may be required to make distributions in 
excess of the yield performance of the Portfolio Securities and may be required to sell 
securities. Unless stated otherwise, the remaining discussion assumes that the Trust is treated as 
a RIC. 15 
Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders 
The discussion in this section applies only to U.S. Holders. A “U.S. Holder” is (i) an 
individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation, or other 
entity taxable as a corporation, created or organized in or under the laws of the 
United States, any state therein or the District of Columbia; or (iii) an estate or trust 
the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its 
source. Distributions.

A “U.S. Holder” is (i) an 
individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation, or other 
entity taxable as a corporation, created or organized in or under the laws of the 
United States, any state therein or the District of Columbia; or (iii) an estate or trust 
the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its 
source. Distributions. Distributions of the Trust’s ordinary income and net short-term 
capital gains will, except as described below with respect to distributions of 
“qualified dividend income,” generally be taxable to U.S. Holders as ordinary income 
to the extent such distributions are paid out of the Trust’s current or accumulated 
earnings and profits, as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Distributions (or deemed distributions, as described below), if any, of net capital 
gains will be taxable as long-term capital gains, regardless of the length of time the 
U.S. Holder has owned Units and such distributions generally will not be considered 
dividends for purposes of the U.S. Holder’s tax treatment. A distribution of an 
amount in excess of the Trust’s current and accumulated earnings and profits will be 
treated as a return of capital that will be applied against and reduce the U.S. Holder’s 
basis in its Units. If the amount of any such distribution exceeds the U.S. Holder’s 
basis in its Units, the excess will be treated as gain from a sale or exchange of the 
Units. The ultimate tax characterization of the distributions that the Trust makes during any 
taxable year cannot be determined until after the end of the taxable year. As a result, 
it is possible that the Trust will make total distributions during a taxable year in an 
amount that exceeds its current and accumulated earnings and profits.

taxable year cannot be determined until after the end of the taxable year. As a result, 
it is possible that the Trust will make total distributions during a taxable year in an 
amount that exceeds its current and accumulated earnings and profits. Return-of-
capital distributions may result, for example, if the Trust makes distributions of cash 
amounts deposited in connection with Portfolio Deposits (as defined below in 
“Purchases and Redemptions of Creation Units — Purchase (Creation)”). Return-of-
capital distributions may be more likely to occur in periods during which the number 
of outstanding Units fluctuates significantly. Distributions of the Trust’s “qualified dividend income” to an individual or other 
non-corporate U.S. Holder will be treated as “qualified dividend income” and will 
therefore be taxed at rates applicable to long-term capital gains, provided that the 
U.S. Holder meets certain holding period and other requirements with respect to its 
Units and that the Trust meets certain holding period and other requirements with 
respect to the underlying shares of stock. “Qualified dividend income” generally 
includes dividends from domestic corporations and dividends from foreign 
corporations that meet certain specified criteria. Dividends distributed by the Trust to a corporate U.S. Holder will qualify for the 
dividends-received deduction only to the extent that the dividends consist of 
distributions of dividends eligible for the dividends-received deduction received by 
the Trust, the Trust meets certain holding period requirements with respect to the 
16 
underlying shares of stock and the U.S. Holder meets certain holding period and 
other requirements with respect to the underlying shares of stock. Dividends eligible 
for the dividends-received deduction generally are dividends from domestic 
corporations.

Holder will not qualify for the dividends-received deduction. The Trust intends to distribute its net capital gains at least annually. If, however, the 
Trust retains any net capital gains for reinvestment, it may elect to treat such net 
capital gains as having been distributed to the Unitholders. If the Trust makes such an 
election, each U.S. Holder will be required to report its share of such undistributed 
net capital gain as long-term capital gain and will be entitled to claim its share of the 
U.S. federal income taxes paid by the Trust on such undistributed net capital gain as a 
credit against its own U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, and to claim a refund 
on a properly filed U.S. federal income tax return to the extent that the credit exceeds 
such tax liability. In addition, each U.S. Holder will be entitled to increase the 
adjusted tax basis of its Units by the difference between its share of such 
undistributed net capital gain and the related credit and/or refund. There can be no 
assurance that the Trust will make this election if it retains all or a portion of its net 
capital gain for a taxable year.

In addition, each U.S. Holder will be entitled to increase the 
adjusted tax basis of its Units by the difference between its share of such 
undistributed net capital gain and the related credit and/or refund. There can be no 
assurance that the Trust will make this election if it retains all or a portion of its net 
capital gain for a taxable year. Because the tax treatment of a distribution depends upon the Trust’s current and 
accumulated earnings and profits, a distribution received shortly after an acquisition 
of Units may be taxable, even though, as an economic matter, the distribution 
represents a return of the U.S. Holder’s initial investment. Although dividends 
generally will be treated as distributed when paid, dividends declared in October, 
November or December, payable to Unitholders of record on a specified date in one 
of those months, and paid during the following January, will be treated for U.S. 
federal income tax purposes as having been distributed by the Trust and received by 
the Unitholders on December 31 of the year in which declared. Unitholders will be 
notified annually as to the U.S. federal tax status of distributions. Sales and Redemptions of Units. In general, upon the sale or other disposition of 
Units, a U.S. Holder will recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the 
difference, if any, between the amount realized on the sale or other disposition and 
the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the relevant Units. Such gain or loss generally 
will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the 
relevant Units was more than one year on the date of the sale or other disposition. Under current law, net capital gain (that is, the excess of net long-term capital gains 
over net short-term capital losses) recognized by non-corporate U.S. Holders is 
generally subject to U.S. federal income tax at lower rates than the rates applicable to 
ordinary income.

over net short-term capital losses) recognized by non-corporate U.S. Holders is 
generally subject to U.S. federal income tax at lower rates than the rates applicable to 
ordinary income. Losses recognized by a U.S. Holder on the sale or other disposition of Units held for 
six months or less will be treated as long-term capital losses to the extent of any 
distribution of long-term capital gain received (or deemed received, as discussed 
above) with respect to such Units. In addition, no loss will be allowed on a sale or 
other disposition of Units if the U.S. Holder acquires Units, or enters into a contract 
17 
or option to acquire Units, within 30 days before or after such sale or other 
disposition. In such a case, the basis of the Units acquired will be adjusted to reflect 
the disallowed loss. If a U.S. Holder receives an in-kind distribution in redemption of Units (which must 
constitute a Creation Unit, as discussed in “Purchases and Redemptions of Creation 
Units — Redemption”), the U.S. Holder will realize gain or loss in an amount equal 
to the difference between the aggregate fair market value as of the redemption date of 
the stocks and cash received in the redemption and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax 
basis in the relevant Units. The U.S. Holder will generally have an initial tax basis in 
the distributed stocks equal to their respective fair market values on the redemption 
date. The IRS may assert that any resulting loss may not be recognized on the ground 
that there has been no material change in the U.S. Holder’s economic position. The 
Trust will not recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes on an in-
kind distribution in redemption of Creation Units.

The IRS may assert that any resulting loss may not be recognized on the ground 
that there has been no material change in the U.S. Holder’s economic position. The 
Trust will not recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes on an in-
kind distribution in redemption of Creation Units. Under U.S. Treasury regulations, if a U.S. Holder recognizes losses with respect to 
Units of $2 million or more for an individual U.S. Holder or $10 million or more for a 
corporate U.S. Holder, the U.S. Holder must file with the IRS a disclosure statement 
on IRS Form 8886. Direct shareholders of portfolio securities are in many cases 
exempted from this reporting requirement, but under current guidance, shareholders of 
a RIC are not exempted. The fact that a loss is reportable under these regulations does 
not affect the legal determination of whether the U.S. Holder’s treatment of the loss is 
proper. Certain states may have similar disclosure requirements. Portfolio Deposits. Upon the transfer of a Portfolio Deposit (as defined below in 
“Purchases and Redemptions of Creation Units — Purchase (Creation)”) to the Trust, 
a U.S. Holder will generally realize gain or loss with respect to each stock included in 
the Portfolio Deposit in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the 
amount received with respect to such stock and the U.S. Holder’s basis in the stock. The amount received with respect to each stock included in a Portfolio Deposit is 
determined by allocating among all of the stocks included in the Portfolio Deposit an 
amount equal to the fair market value of the Creation Units received (determined as 
of the date of transfer of the Portfolio Deposit) plus the amount of any cash received 
from the Trust, reduced by the amount of any cash that the U.S. Holder pays to the 
Trust. This allocation is made among such stocks in accordance with their relative 
fair market values as of the date of transfer of the Portfolio Deposit.

economic position of the U.S. Holder. The Trust will not recognize gain or loss for 
U.S. federal income tax purposes on the issuance of Creation Units in exchange for 
Portfolio Deposits. Backup Withholding and Information Reporting. Payments on the Units and 
proceeds from a sale or other disposition of Units will be subject to information 
reporting unless the U.S. Holder is an exempt recipient. A U.S. Holder will be subject 
to backup withholding on all such amounts unless (i) the U.S. Holder is an exempt 
18 
recipient or (ii) the U.S. Holder provides its correct taxpayer identification number 
(generally, on IRS Form W-9) and certifies that it is not subject to backup 
withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld 
pursuant to the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a credit against the U.S. 
Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle the U.S. Holder to a refund, 
provided that the required information is furnished to the IRS on a timely basis. Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders 
The discussion in this section applies only to Non-U.S. Holders.

Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle the U.S. Holder to a refund, 
provided that the required information is furnished to the IRS on a timely basis. Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders 
The discussion in this section applies only to Non-U.S. Holders. A “Non-U.S. 
Holder” is a person that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, is a beneficial owner 
of Units and is a nonresident alien individual, a foreign corporation, a foreign trust or 
a foreign estate. The discussion below does not apply to a Non-U.S. Holder who is a 
nonresident alien individual and is present in the United States for 183 days or more 
during any taxable year; a nonresident alien individual who is a former citizen or 
resident of the United States; an expatriated entity; a controlled foreign corporation; a 
passive foreign investment company; a foreign government for purposes of 
Section 892 of the Code; or a tax-exempt organization for U.S. federal income tax 
purposes. Such Non-U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors with respect to the 
particular tax consequences to them of an investment in the Trust. The U.S. federal 
income taxation of a Non-U.S. Holder depends on whether the income that the Non-
U.S. Holder derives from the Trust is “effectively connected” with a trade or business 
that the Non-U.S. Holder conducts in the United States (and, if required by an 
applicable tax treaty, is attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment maintained by 
the Non-U.S. Holder).

U.S. Holder derives from the Trust is “effectively connected” with a trade or business 
that the Non-U.S. Holder conducts in the United States (and, if required by an

the Non-U.S. Holder). If the income that a Non-U.S. Holder derives from the Trust is not “effectively 
connected” with a U.S. trade or business conducted by such Non-U.S. Holder (or, if 
an applicable tax treaty so provides, the Non-U.S. Holder does not maintain a 
permanent establishment in the United States), distributions of “investment company 
taxable income” to such Non-U.S. Holder will generally be subject to U.S. federal 
withholding tax at a rate of 30% (or lower rate under an applicable tax treaty). Provided that certain requirements are satisfied, this withholding tax will not be 
imposed on dividends paid by the Trust to the extent that the underlying income out 
of which the dividends are paid consists of U.S.-source interest income or short-term 
capital gains that would not have been subject to U.S. withholding tax if received 
directly by the Non-U.S. Holder (“interest-related dividends” and “short-term capital 
gain dividends,” respectively). A Non-U.S. Holder whose income from the Trust is not “effectively connected” with 
a U.S. trade or business (or, if an applicable tax treaty so provides, does not maintain 
a permanent establishment in the United States) will generally be exempt from U.S. 
federal income tax on capital gain dividends and any amounts retained by the Trust 
that are designated as undistributed capital gains.

federal income tax on capital gain dividends and any amounts retained by the Trust 
that are designated as undistributed capital gains. In addition, such a Non-U.S. Holder 
will generally be exempt from U.S. federal income tax on any gains realized upon the 
sale or exchange of Units. 19 If the income from the Trust is “effectively connected” with a U.S. trade or business 
carried on by a Non-U.S. Holder (and, if required by an applicable tax treaty, is 
attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment maintained by the Non-U.S. Holder), 
any distributions of “investment company taxable income,” any capital gain 
dividends, any amounts retained by the Trust that are designated as undistributed 
capital gains and any gains realized upon the sale or exchange of Units will be 
subject to U.S. federal income tax, on a net income basis, at the rates applicable to 
U.S. Holders. In such a case, the Non-U.S. Holder will be exempt from the U.S. 
federal withholding tax on distributions of “investment company taxable income” 
discussed above, although the Non-U.S. Holder will need to deliver to the relevant 
withholding agent a properly executed IRS Form W-8ECI in order to claim an 
exemption from withholding.

the Units and may be filed in connection with payments of the proceeds from a sale 
or other disposition of Units. A Non-U.S. Holder may be subject to backup 
withholding on distributions or on the proceeds from a redemption or other 
disposition of Units if such Non-U.S. Holder does not certify its non-U.S. status 
under penalties of perjury or otherwise establish an exemption. Backup withholding 
is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld pursuant to the backup withholding

tax liability, if any, and may entitle the Non-U.S. Holder to a refund, provided that

dividends, to qualify for an exemption from U.S. backup withholding and to qualify 
for a reduced rate of U.S. withholding tax on Trust distributions pursuant to an 
income tax treaty, a Non-U.S. Holder must generally deliver to the withholding agent 
a properly executed IRS form (generally, Form W-8BEN or Form W-8BEN-E, as 
applicable). In order to claim a refund of any Trust-level taxes imposed on 
undistributed net capital gain, any withholding taxes or any backup withholding, a 
Non-U.S. Holder must obtain a U.S. taxpayer identification number and file a U.S. 
federal income tax return, even if the Non-U.S. Holder would not otherwise be 
required to obtain a U.S. taxpayer identification number or file a U.S. income tax 
return. Under Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (“FATCA”), a withholding tax at the 
rate of 30% will generally be imposed on payments of dividends on Units to certain 
foreign entities (including financial intermediaries) unless the foreign entity provides 
the withholding agent with certifications and other information (which may include 
information relating to ownership by U.S. persons of interests in, or accounts with, 
the foreign entity).

In order to claim a refund of any Trust-level taxes imposed on 
undistributed net capital gain, any withholding taxes or any backup withholding, a 
Non-U.S. Holder must obtain a U.S. taxpayer identification number and file a U.S. 
federal income tax return, even if the Non-U.S. Holder would not otherwise be

foreign entities (including financial intermediaries) unless the foreign entity provides 
the withholding agent with certifications and other information (which may include 
information relating to ownership by U.S. persons of interests in, or accounts with, 
the foreign entity). Treasury and the IRS have issued proposed regulations that 
(i) provide that “withholdable payments” will not include gross proceeds from the 
disposition of property that can produce U.S.-source dividends or interest, as 
otherwise would have been the case after December 31, 2018 and (ii) state that 
20 
taxpayers may rely on these provisions of the proposed regulations until final 
regulations are issued. If FATCA withholding is imposed, a beneficial owner of 
Units that is not a foreign financial institution generally may obtain a refund of any 
amounts withheld by filing a U.S. federal income tax return (which may entail 
significant administrative burden). Non-U.S. Holders should consult their tax 
advisors regarding the possible implications of FATCA on their investment in Units. 21

Prospective purchasers of Units are urged to consult their tax advisors with regard to 
the application of the U.S. federal income and estate tax laws to their particular 
situations, as well as any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local 
or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction. Taxation of the Trust 
The Trust believes that it qualified as a regulated investment company under 
Subchapter M of the Code (a “RIC”) for its taxable year ended October 31, 2024 and 
intends to qualify as a RIC in the current and future taxable years. Assuming that the 
Trust so qualifies and that it satisfies the distribution requirements described below, 
the Trust generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on income 
distributed in a timely manner to the holders of its Units (“Unitholders”). To qualify as a RIC for any taxable year, the Trust must, among other things, satisfy 
both an income test and an asset diversification test for such taxable year.

market or the substantial equivalent thereof and (ii) less than 90% of such entity’s 
gross income for the relevant taxable year consists of Qualifying RIC Income. The 
Trust’s share of income derived from a partnership other than a “qualified publicly 
traded partnership” will be treated as Qualifying RIC Income only to the extent that 
such income would have constituted Qualifying RIC Income if derived directly by 
the Trust.

A 
“qualified publicly traded partnership” is generally defined as an entity that is treated 
as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes if (i) interests in such entity are 
traded on an established securities market or are readily tradable on a secondary 
market or the substantial equivalent thereof and (ii) less than 90% of such entity’s 
gross income for the relevant taxable year consists of Qualifying RIC Income. The 
Trust’s share of income derived from a partnership other than a “qualified publicly 
traded partnership” will be treated as Qualifying RIC Income only to the extent that 
such income would have constituted Qualifying RIC Income if derived directly by 
the Trust. In order to be exempt from U.S. federal income tax on its distributed income, the 
Trust must distribute to its Unitholders on a timely basis at least 90% of the sum of 
(i) its “investment company taxable income” (determined prior to the deduction for 
14 
dividends paid by the Trust) and (ii) its net tax-exempt interest income for each 
taxable year. In general, a RIC’s “investment company taxable income” for any 
taxable year is its taxable income, determined without regard to net capital gain (that 
is, the excess of net long-term capital gains over net short-term capital losses) and 
with certain other adjustments. Any taxable income, including any net capital gain, 
that the Trust does not distribute to its Unitholders in a timely manner will be subject 
to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates. A RIC will be subject to a nondeductible 4% excise tax on certain amounts that it 
fails to distribute during each calendar year.

Any taxable income, including any net capital gain, 
that the Trust does not distribute to its Unitholders in a timely manner will be subject 
to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates. A RIC will be subject to a nondeductible 4% excise tax on certain amounts that it 
fails to distribute during each calendar year. In order to avoid this excise tax, a RIC 
must distribute during each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of 
(i) 98% of its ordinary taxable income for the calendar year, (ii) 98.2% of its capital 
gain net income for the one-year period ended on October 31 of the calendar year and 
(iii) any ordinary income and capital gains for previous years that were not 
distributed during those years. For purposes of determining whether the Trust has met 
this distribution requirement, (i) certain ordinary gains and losses that would 
otherwise be taken into account for the portion of the calendar year after October 31 
will be treated as arising on January 1 of the following calendar year and (ii) the 
Trust will be deemed to have distributed any income or gains on which it has paid 
U.S. federal income tax. If the Trust failed to qualify as a RIC or failed to satisfy the 90% distribution 
requirement in any taxable year, the Trust would be subject to U.S. federal income 
tax at regular corporate rates on its taxable income, including its net capital gain, 
even if such income were distributed to its Unitholders, and all distributions out of 
earnings and profits would be taxable as dividend income. Such distributions 
generally would be eligible for the dividends-received deduction in the case of 
corporate U.S. Holders (defined below) and would constitute “qualified dividend 
income” for individual U.S. Holders. See “Federal Income Taxes — Tax 
Consequences to U.S. Holders — Distributions.”

required to recognize unrealized gains, pay taxes and make distributions (which 
could be subject to interest charges) before requalifying for taxation as a RIC. If the 
Trust fails to satisfy the income test or diversification test described above, however, 
it may be able to avoid losing its status as a RIC by timely curing such failure, paying 
a tax and/or providing notice of such failure to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the 
“IRS”). In order to meet the distribution requirements necessary to be exempt from U.S. 
federal income and excise tax, the Trust may be required to make distributions in 
excess of the yield performance of the Portfolio Securities and may be required to sell 
securities. Unless stated otherwise, the remaining discussion assumes that the Trust is treated as 
a RIC. 15

Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders 
The discussion in this section applies only to U.S. Holders. A “U.S. Holder” is (i) an 
individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation, or other 
entity taxable as a corporation, created or organized in or under the laws of the 
United States, any state therein or the District of Columbia; or (iii) an estate or trust 
the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its 
source. Distributions. Distributions of the Trust’s ordinary income and net short-term 
capital gains will, except as described below with respect to distributions of 
“qualified dividend income,” generally be taxable to U.S. Holders as ordinary income 
to the extent such distributions are paid out of the Trust’s current or accumulated 
earnings and profits, as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Distributions (or deemed distributions, as described below), if any, of net capital 
gains will be taxable as long-term capital gains, regardless of the length of time the 
U.S. Holder has owned Units and such distributions generally will not be considered 
dividends for purposes of the U.S. Holder’s tax treatment. A distribution of an 
amount in excess of the Trust’s current and accumulated earnings and profits will be 
treated as a return of capital that will be applied against and reduce the U.S. Holder’s 
basis in its Units. If the amount of any such distribution exceeds the U.S. Holder’s 
basis in its Units, the excess will be treated as gain from a sale or exchange of the 
Units. The ultimate tax characterization of the distributions that the Trust makes during any 
taxable year cannot be determined until after the end of the taxable year. As a result, 
it is possible that the Trust will make total distributions during a taxable year in an 
amount that exceeds its current and accumulated earnings and profits.

The ultimate tax characterization of the distributions that the Trust makes during any 
taxable year cannot be determined until after the end of the taxable year. As a result, 
it is possible that the Trust will make total distributions during a taxable year in an 
amount that exceeds its current and accumulated earnings and profits. Return-of-
capital distributions may result, for example, if the Trust makes distributions of cash 
amounts deposited in connection with Portfolio Deposits (as defined below in 
“Purchases and Redemptions of Creation Units — Purchase (Creation)”). Return-of-
capital distributions may be more likely to occur in periods during which the number 
of outstanding Units fluctuates significantly. Distributions of the Trust’s “qualified dividend income” to an individual or other 
non-corporate U.S. Holder will be treated as “qualified dividend income” and will 
therefore be taxed at rates applicable to long-term capital gains, provided that the 
U.S. Holder meets certain holding period and other requirements with respect to its 
Units and that the Trust meets certain holding period and other requirements with 
respect to the underlying shares of stock. “Qualified dividend income” generally 
includes dividends from domestic corporations and dividends from foreign 
corporations that meet certain specified criteria. Dividends distributed by the Trust to a corporate U.S. Holder will qualify for the 
dividends-received deduction only to the extent that the dividends consist of 
distributions of dividends eligible for the dividends-received deduction received by 
the Trust, the Trust meets certain holding period requirements with respect to the 
16 
underlying shares of stock and the U.S. Holder meets certain holding period and 
other requirements with respect to the underlying shares of stock. Dividends eligible 
for the dividends-received deduction generally are dividends from domestic 
corporations.

Holder will not qualify for the dividends-received deduction. The Trust intends to distribute its net capital gains at least annually. If, however, the 
Trust retains any net capital gains for reinvestment, it may elect to treat such net 
capital gains as having been distributed to the Unitholders. If the Trust makes such an 
election, each U.S. Holder will be required to report its share of such undistributed 
net capital gain as long-term capital gain and will be entitled to claim its share of the 
U.S. federal income taxes paid by the Trust on such undistributed net capital gain as a 
credit against its own U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, and to claim a refund 
on a properly filed U.S. federal income tax return to the extent that the credit exceeds 
such tax liability. In addition, each U.S. Holder will be entitled to increase the 
adjusted tax basis of its Units by the difference between its share of such 
undistributed net capital gain and the related credit and/or refund. There can be no 
assurance that the Trust will make this election if it retains all or a portion of its net 
capital gain for a taxable year.

undistributed net capital gain and the related credit and/or refund. There can be no 
assurance that the Trust will make this election if it retains all or a portion of its net 
capital gain for a taxable year. Because the tax treatment of a distribution depends upon the Trust’s current and 
accumulated earnings and profits, a distribution received shortly after an acquisition 
of Units may be taxable, even though, as an economic matter, the distribution 
represents a return of the U.S. Holder’s initial investment. Although dividends 
generally will be treated as distributed when paid, dividends declared in October, 
November or December, payable to Unitholders of record on a specified date in one 
of those months, and paid during the following January, will be treated for U.S. 
federal income tax purposes as having been distributed by the Trust and received by 
the Unitholders on December 31 of the year in which declared. Unitholders will be 
notified annually as to the U.S. federal tax status of distributions. Sales and Redemptions of Units. In general, upon the sale or other disposition of 
Units, a U.S. Holder will recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the 
difference, if any, between the amount realized on the sale or other disposition and 
the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the relevant Units. Such gain or loss generally 
will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the 
relevant Units was more than one year on the date of the sale or other disposition. Under current law, net capital gain (that is, the excess of net long-term capital gains 
over net short-term capital losses) recognized by non-corporate U.S. Holders is 
generally subject to U.S. federal income tax at lower rates than the rates applicable to 
ordinary income.

over net short-term capital losses) recognized by non-corporate U.S. Holders is 
generally subject to U.S. federal income tax at lower rates than the rates applicable to 
ordinary income. Losses recognized by a U.S. Holder on the sale or other disposition of Units held for 
six months or less will be treated as long-term capital losses to the extent of any 
distribution of long-term capital gain received (or deemed received, as discussed 
above) with respect to such Units. In addition, no loss will be allowed on a sale or 
other disposition of Units if the U.S. Holder acquires Units, or enters into a contract 
17 
or option to acquire Units, within 30 days before or after such sale or other 
disposition. In such a case, the basis of the Units acquired will be adjusted to reflect 
the disallowed loss. If a U.S. Holder receives an in-kind distribution in redemption of Units (which must 
constitute a Creation Unit, as discussed in “Purchases and Redemptions of Creation 
Units — Redemption”), the U.S. Holder will realize gain or loss in an amount equal 
to the difference between the aggregate fair market value as of the redemption date of 
the stocks and cash received in the redemption and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax 
basis in the relevant Units. The U.S. Holder will generally have an initial tax basis in 
the distributed stocks equal to their respective fair market values on the redemption 
date. The IRS may assert that any resulting loss may not be recognized on the ground 
that there has been no material change in the U.S. Holder’s economic position. The 
Trust will not recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes on an in-
kind distribution in redemption of Creation Units.

that there has been no material change in the U.S. Holder’s economic position. The 
Trust will not recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes on an in-
kind distribution in redemption of Creation Units. Under U.S. Treasury regulations, if a U.S. Holder recognizes losses with respect to 
Units of $2 million or more for an individual U.S. Holder or $10 million or more for a 
corporate U.S. Holder, the U.S. Holder must file with the IRS a disclosure statement 
on IRS Form 8886. Direct shareholders of portfolio securities are in many cases 
exempted from this reporting requirement, but under current guidance, shareholders of 
a RIC are not exempted. The fact that a loss is reportable under these regulations does 
not affect the legal determination of whether the U.S. Holder’s treatment of the loss is 
proper. Certain states may have similar disclosure requirements. Portfolio Deposits. Upon the transfer of a Portfolio Deposit (as defined below in 
“Purchases and Redemptions of Creation Units — Purchase (Creation)”) to the Trust, 
a U.S. Holder will generally realize gain or loss with respect to each stock included in 
the Portfolio Deposit in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the 
amount received with respect to such stock and the U.S. Holder’s basis in the stock. The amount received with respect to each stock included in a Portfolio Deposit is 
determined by allocating among all of the stocks included in the Portfolio Deposit an 
amount equal to the fair market value of the Creation Units received (determined as 
of the date of transfer of the Portfolio Deposit) plus the amount of any cash received 
from the Trust, reduced by the amount of any cash that the U.S. Holder pays to the 
Trust. This allocation is made among such stocks in accordance with their relative 
fair market values as of the date of transfer of the Portfolio Deposit.

U.S. federal income tax purposes on the issuance of Creation Units in exchange for 
Portfolio Deposits. Backup Withholding and Information Reporting. Payments on the Units and 
proceeds from a sale or other disposition of Units will be subject to information 
reporting unless the U.S. Holder is an exempt recipient. A U.S. Holder will be subject 
to backup withholding on all such amounts unless (i) the U.S. Holder is an exempt 
18 
recipient or (ii) the U.S. Holder provides its correct taxpayer identification number 
(generally, on IRS Form W-9) and certifies that it is not subject to backup

passive foreign investment company; a foreign government for purposes of 
Section 892 of the Code; or a tax-exempt organization for U.S. federal income tax 
purposes. Such Non-U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors with respect to the 
particular tax consequences to them of an investment in the Trust. The U.S. federal 
income taxation of a Non-U.S. Holder depends on whether the income that the Non-
U.S. Holder derives from the Trust is “effectively connected” with a trade or business 
that the Non-U.S. Holder conducts in the United States (and, if required by an 
applicable tax treaty, is attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment maintained by 
the Non-U.S. Holder).

particular tax consequences to them of an investment in the Trust. The U.S. federal 
income taxation of a Non-U.S. Holder depends on whether the income that the Non-
U.S. Holder derives from the Trust is “effectively connected” with a trade or business 
that the Non-U.S. Holder conducts in the United States (and, if required by an 
applicable tax treaty, is attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment maintained by 
the Non-U.S. Holder).

U.S. Holder derives from the Trust is “effectively connected” with a trade or business 
that the Non-U.S. Holder conducts in the United States (and, if required by an 
applicable tax treaty, is attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment maintained by 
the Non-U.S. Holder). If the income that a Non-U.S. Holder derives from the Trust is not “effectively 
connected” with a U.S. trade or business conducted by such Non-U.S. Holder (or, if 
an applicable tax treaty so provides, the Non-U.S. Holder does not maintain a 
permanent establishment in the United States), distributions of “investment company 
taxable income” to such Non-U.S. Holder will generally be subject to U.S. federal 
withholding tax at a rate of 30% (or lower rate under an applicable tax treaty). Provided that certain requirements are satisfied, this withholding tax will not be 
imposed on dividends paid by the Trust to the extent that the underlying income out 
of which the dividends are paid consists of U.S.-source interest income or short-term 
capital gains that would not have been subject to U.S. withholding tax if received 
directly by the Non-U.S. Holder (“interest-related dividends” and “short-term capital 
gain dividends,” respectively). A Non-U.S. Holder whose income from the Trust is not “effectively connected” with 
a U.S. trade or business (or, if an applicable tax treaty so provides, does not maintain 
a permanent establishment in the United States) will generally be exempt from U.S. 
federal income tax on capital gain dividends and any amounts retained by the Trust 
that are designated as undistributed capital gains.

will generally be exempt from U.S. federal income tax on any gains realized upon the 
sale or exchange of Units. 19 If the income from the Trust is “effectively connected” with a U.S. trade or business 
carried on by a Non-U.S. Holder (and, if required by an applicable tax treaty, is 
attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment maintained by the Non-U.S. Holder), 
any distributions of “investment company taxable income,” any capital gain 
dividends, any amounts retained by the Trust that are designated as undistributed 
capital gains and any gains realized upon the sale or exchange of Units will be 
subject to U.S. federal income tax, on a net income basis, at the rates applicable to 
U.S. Holders. In such a case, the Non-U.S. Holder will be exempt from the U.S. 
federal withholding tax on distributions of “investment company taxable income” 
discussed above, although the Non-U.S. Holder will need to deliver to the relevant 
withholding agent a properly executed IRS Form W-8ECI in order to claim an 
exemption from withholding.

the Units and may be filed in connection with payments of the proceeds from a sale 
or other disposition of Units. A Non-U.S. Holder may be subject to backup 
withholding on distributions or on the proceeds from a redemption or other 
disposition of Units if such Non-U.S. Holder does not certify its non-U.S. status 
under penalties of perjury or otherwise establish an exemption. Backup withholding 
is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld pursuant to the backup withholding 
rules will be allowed as a credit against the Non-U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income 
tax liability, if any, and may entitle the Non-U.S. Holder to a refund, provided that 
the required information is furnished to the IRS on a timely basis.

for a reduced rate of U.S. withholding tax on Trust distributions pursuant to an 
income tax treaty, a Non-U.S. Holder must generally deliver to the withholding agent 
a properly executed IRS form (generally, Form W-8BEN or Form W-8BEN-E, as 
applicable). In order to claim a refund of any Trust-level taxes imposed on 
undistributed net capital gain, any withholding taxes or any backup withholding, a 
Non-U.S. Holder must obtain a U.S. taxpayer identification number and file a U.S. 
federal income tax return, even if the Non-U.S. Holder would not otherwise be 
required to obtain a U.S. taxpayer identification number or file a U.S. income tax 
return. Under Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (“FATCA”), a withholding tax at the 
rate of 30% will generally be imposed on payments of dividends on Units to certain 
foreign entities (including financial intermediaries) unless the foreign entity provides 
the withholding agent with certifications and other information (which may include 
information relating to ownership by U.S. persons of interests in, or accounts with, 
the foreign entity).

(i) provide that “withholdable payments” will not include gross proceeds from the 
disposition of property that can produce U.S.-source dividends or interest, as 
otherwise would have been the case after December 31, 2018 and (ii) state that 
20 
taxpayers may rely on these provisions of the proposed regulations until final 
regulations are issued. If FATCA withholding is imposed, a beneficial owner of 
Units that is not a foreign financial institution generally may obtain a refund of any 
amounts withheld by filing a U.S. federal income tax return (which may entail 
significant administrative burden). Non-U.S. Holders should consult their tax 
advisors regarding the possible implications of FATCA on their investment in Units. 21

SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust 
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
To the Trustee and Unitholders of SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust 
Opinion on the Financial Statements 
We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including the 
schedule of investments, of SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (the 
“Trust”) as of October 31, 2024, the related statements of operations and of changes 
in net assets for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2024, 
including the related notes, and the financial highlights for each of the five years in 
the period ended October 31, 2024 (collectively referred to as the “financial 
statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material 
respects, the financial position of the Trust as of October 31, 2024, the results of its 
operations and the changes in its net assets for each of the three years in the period 
ended October 31, 2024 and the financial highlights for each of the five years in the 
period ended October 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally 
accepted in the United States of America. Basis for Opinion 
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Trust’s management. Our 
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Trust’s financial statements based on 
our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company 
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be 
independent with respect to the Trust in accordance with the U.S. federal securities 
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange 
Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits of these financial statements in accordance with the 
standards of the PCAOB.

Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be 
independent with respect to the Trust in accordance with the U.S. federal securities 
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange 
Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits of these financial statements in accordance with the 
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit 
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of 
material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material 
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and 
performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included 
examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the 
financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles 
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of 
securities owned as of October 31, 2024, by correspondence with the custodian and 
brokers; when replies were not received from brokers, we performed other auditing 
procedures. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP 
Boston, Massachusetts 
December 19, 2024 We have served as the auditor of one or more investment companies in the SPDR 
Trusts since 1993.

SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust 
Notes to Financial Statements 
October 31, 2024 
Note 1 — Organization 
SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (the “Trust”) is a unit investment 
trust created under the laws of the State of New York and registered under the 
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The Trust is an “Exchange-Traded 
Fund”, the units of which are listed on and traded on the New York Stock Exchange 
(“NYSE”) under the symbol “DIA”, and operates under an exemptive order granted 
by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The Trust was created 
to provide investors with the opportunity to purchase a security representing a 
proportionate undivided interest in a portfolio of securities consisting of substantially 
all of the component common stocks, in substantially the same weighting, which 
comprise the Dow Jones Industrial Average (the “DJIA”). Each unit of fractional 
undivided interest in the Trust is referred to as a “Unit”. The Trust commenced 
operations on January 14, 1998 upon the initial issuance of 500,000 Units (equivalent 
to ten “Creation Units” — see Note 4) in exchange for a portfolio of securities 
assembled to reflect the intended portfolio composition of the Trust. Under the Amended and Restated Standard Terms and Conditions of the Trust, as 
amended (the “Trust Agreement”), PDR Services, LLC (the “Sponsor”) and State 
Street Global Advisors Trust Company (the “Trustee”) are indemnified against 
certain liabilities arising out of the performance of their duties to the Trust. Additionally, in the normal course of business, the Trust enters into contracts that 
contain general indemnification clauses.

amended (the “Trust Agreement”), PDR Services, LLC (the “Sponsor”) and State 
Street Global Advisors Trust Company (the “Trustee”) are indemnified against 
certain liabilities arising out of the performance of their duties to the Trust. Additionally, in the normal course of business, the Trust enters into contracts that 
contain general indemnification clauses. The Trust’s maximum exposure under these 
arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made 
against the Trust that have not yet occurred. However, based on experience, the 
Trustee expects the risk of material loss to be remote. The Sponsor is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Intercontinental Exchange, 
Inc. (“ICE”). ICE is a publicly-traded entity, trading on the NYSE under the symbol 
“ICE.” Note 2 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the 
Trustee (who is responsible for the preparation of the Trust’s financial statements) in 
the preparation of the Trust’s financial statements: 
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted 
accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) requires the Trustee to make estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Trust is an 
investment company under U.S. GAAP and follows the accounting and reporting 
guidance applicable to investment companies. 27

Security Valuation 
The Trust’s investments are valued at fair value each day that the NYSE is open and, 
for financial reporting purposes, as of the report date should the reporting period end 
on a day that the NYSE is not open.

Security Valuation 
The Trust’s investments are valued at fair value each day that the NYSE is open and, 
for financial reporting purposes, as of the report date should the reporting period end 
on a day that the NYSE is not open. Fair value is generally defined as the price a fund 
would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction 
between market participants at the measurement date. By its nature, a fair value price 
is a good faith estimate of the valuation in a current sale and may not reflect an actual 
market price. The investments of the Trust are valued pursuant to the policy and 
procedures developed by the Oversight Committee of the Trustee (the “Committee”). The Committee provides oversight of the valuation of investments for the Trust. Valuation techniques used to value the Trust’s equity investments are as follows: 
Equity investments (including preferred stocks) traded on a recognized securities 
exchange for which market quotations are readily available are valued at the last sale 
price or official closing price, as applicable, on the primary market or exchange on 
which they trade. Equity investments traded on a recognized exchange for which 
there were no sales on that day are valued at the last published sale price or at fair 
value. In the event that prices or quotations are not readily available or that the application 
of these valuation methods results in a price for an investment that is deemed to be 
not representative of the fair value of such investment, fair value will be determined 
in good faith by the Committee, in accordance with the valuation policy and 
procedures approved by the Trustee.

of these valuation methods results in a price for an investment that is deemed to be 
not representative of the fair value of such investment, fair value will be determined 
in good faith by the Committee, in accordance with the valuation policy and 
procedures approved by the Trustee. Fair value pricing could result in a difference between the prices used to calculate the 
Trust’s net asset value (“NAV”) and the prices used by the Trust’s underlying index, 
the DJIA, which in turn could result in a difference between the Trust’s performance 
and the performance of the DJIA. The Trustee values the Trust’s assets and liabilities at fair value using a hierarchy that 
prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques, giving the highest priority to readily 
available unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
(Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 
measurements) when market prices are not readily available or reliable. The 
categorization of a value determined for an investment within the hierarchy is based 
upon the pricing transparency of the investment and is not necessarily an indication 
of the risk associated with the investment. 28

SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust 
Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

Note 2 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – (continued) The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: 
• Level 1 — Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or 
liabilities; 
• Level 2 — Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are 
observable for the assets or liabilities either directly or indirectly, including 
quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices 
for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not considered 
to be active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset 
or liability (such as exchange rates, financing terms, interest rates, yield 
curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and default 
rates) or other market-corroborated inputs; and 
• Level 3 — Unobservable inputs for the assets or liabilities, including the 
Committee’s assumptions used in determining the fair value of investments. Investment Transactions and Income Recognition 
Investment transactions are accounted for on the trade date for financial reporting 
purposes. Dividend income and capital gain distributions, if any, are recognized on 
the ex-dividend date, or when the information becomes available, net of any foreign 
taxes withheld at source, if any. Non-cash dividends received in the form of stock, if 
any, are recorded as dividend income at fair value. Realized gains and losses from the 
sale or disposition of investments are determined using the identified cost method.

Non-cash dividends received in the form of stock, if 
any, are recorded as dividend income at fair value. Realized gains and losses from the 
sale or disposition of investments are determined using the identified cost method. Distributions 
The Trust declares and distributes dividends from net investment income, if any, to 
its holders of Units (“Unitholders”), monthly. Capital gain distributions, if any, are 
generally declared and paid annually. Additional distributions may be paid by the 
Trust to avoid imposition of federal income and excise tax on any remaining 
undistributed net investment income and capital gains. The amount and character of 
income and gains to be distributed are determined in accordance with federal tax 
regulations which may differ from net investment income and realized gains 
recognized for U.S. GAAP purposes. Equalization 
The Trustee follows the accounting practice known as “Equalization” by which a 
portion of the proceeds from sales and costs of reacquiring the Trust’s Units, 
equivalent on a per Unit basis to the amount of distributable net investment income 
on the date of the transaction, is credited or charged to undistributed net investment 
income. As a result, undistributed net investment income per Unit is unaffected by

sales or reacquisitions of the Trust’s Units. Amounts related to Equalization can be 
found on the Statements of Changes in Net Assets. Federal Income Taxes 
For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Trust has qualified as a “regulated 
investment company” under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as 
amended (a “RIC”), and intends to continue to qualify as a RIC.

Amounts related to Equalization can be 
found on the Statements of Changes in Net Assets. Federal Income Taxes 
For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Trust has qualified as a “regulated 
investment company” under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as 
amended (a “RIC”), and intends to continue to qualify as a RIC. As a RIC, the Trust 
will generally not be subject to U.S. federal income tax for any taxable year on 
income, including net capital gains, that it distributes to its Unitholders, provided that 
it distributes on a timely basis at least 90% of its “investment company taxable 
income” determined prior to the deduction for dividends paid by the Trust (generally, 
its taxable income other than net capital gain) for such taxable year. In addition, 
provided that the Trust distributes substantially all of its ordinary income and capital 
gains during each calendar year, the Trust will not be subject to U.S. federal excise 
tax. Income and capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with U.S. 
federal income tax principles, which may differ from U.S. GAAP. These book-tax 
differences are primarily due to differing treatments for in-kind transactions and 
losses deferred due to wash sales. U.S. GAAP requires the evaluation of tax positions taken in the course of preparing 
the Trust’s tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are more likely than not 
to be sustained by the applicable tax authority. For U.S. GAAP purposes, the Trust 
recognizes the tax benefits of uncertain tax positions only when the position is more 
likely than not to be sustained, assuming examination by tax authorities. The Trustee has reviewed the Trust’s tax positions for the open tax years as of 
October 31, 2024 and has determined that no provision for income tax is required in 
the Trust’s financial statements.

the Trust’s financial statements. Generally, the Trust’s tax returns for the prior three 
fiscal years remain subject to examinations by the Trust’s major tax jurisdictions, 
which include the United States of America, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts 
and the State of New York. The Trustee has the Trust recognize interest and 
penalties, if any, related to tax liabilities as income tax expense in the Statements of 
Operations. There were no such expenses for the year ended October 31, 2024. No income tax returns are currently under examination. The Trustee has analyzed the 
relevant tax laws and regulations and their application to the Trust’s facts and 
circumstances and does not believe there are any uncertain tax positions that require 
recognition of any tax liabilities. Any potential tax liability is also subject to ongoing 
interpretation of laws by taxing authorities. The tax treatment of the Trust’s 
investments may change over time based on factors including, but not limited to, new 
tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. 30

Note 3 — Transactions with Affiliates of the Trustee and Sponsor – (continued) 
trademarks in connection with their rights and duties with respect to the Trust. The 
License Agreement may be amended without the consent of any of the owners of 
beneficial interests of Units. The License Agreement automatically renews for 
successive annual periods, unless terminated in accordance with its terms. Pursuant to 
such arrangements and in accordance with the Trust Agreement, the Trust reimburses 
the Sponsor for payment of fees under the License Agreement to S&P OPCO equal 
to 0.05% on the first $1 billion of the then rolling average asset balance and 0.04% on 
any excess rolling average asset balance over and above $1 billion. The minimum 
annual license fee for the Trust is $1 million. The Sponsor has entered into an agreement with the Marketing Agent pursuant to 
which the Marketing Agent has agreed to market and promote the Trust. The 
Marketing Agent is reimbursed by the Sponsor for the expenses it incurs for 
providing such services out of amounts that the Trust reimburses the Sponsor. Expenses incurred by the Marketing Agent include, but are not limited to: printing 
and distribution of marketing materials describing the Trust, associated legal, 
consulting, advertising and marketing costs and other out-of-pocket expenses.

The 
Marketing Agent is reimbursed by the Sponsor for the expenses it incurs for 
providing such services out of amounts that the Trust reimburses the Sponsor. Expenses incurred by the Marketing Agent include, but are not limited to: printing 
and distribution of marketing materials describing the Trust, associated legal, 
consulting, advertising and marketing costs and other out-of-pocket expenses. ALPS Distributors, Inc. (the “Distributor”) serves as the distributor of the Units. The 
Sponsor pays the Distributor for its services a flat annual fee of $35,000, and the 
Trust does not reimburse the Sponsor for this fee. Note 4 — Unitholder Transactions 
Units are issued and redeemed by the Trust only in Creation Unit size aggregations of 
50,000 Units. Such transactions are only permitted on an in-kind basis, with a 
separate cash payment that is equivalent to the undistributed net investment income 
per Unit (income equalization) and a balancing cash component to equate the 
transaction to the NAV per Unit of the Trust on the transaction date. There is a 
transaction fee payable to the Trustee in connection with each creation and 
redemption of Creation Units made through the clearing process (the “Transaction 
Fee”). The Transaction Fee is non-refundable, regardless of the NAV of the Trust. The Transaction Fee is the lesser of $1,000 or 0.10% (10 basis points) of the value of 
one Creation Unit at the time of creation per participating party per day, regardless of 
the number of Creation Units created or redeemed on such day. The Transaction Fee 
is currently $1,000. For creations and redemptions outside the clearing process, 
including orders from a participating party restricted from engaging in transactions in 
one or more of the common stocks that are included in the DJIA, an additional 
amount not to exceed three (3) times the Transaction Fee applicable for one Creation 
Unit is charged per Creation Unit per day.

Note 5 — Investment Transactions For the year ended October 31, 2024, the Trust had in-kind contributions, in-kind 
redemptions, purchases and sales of investment securities of $27,939,187,281, 
$26,902,621,010, $1,076,661,743, and $1,077,829,829, respectively. Net realized 
gain (loss) on investment transactions in the Statement of Operations includes net 
gains resulting from in-kind transactions of $3,340,262,554. Note 6 — Equity Investing and Market Risk 
An investment in the Trust involves risks similar to those of investing in any fund of 
equity securities, such as market fluctuations caused by such factors as economic and 
political developments, changes in interest rates, perceived trends in securities prices, 
war, acts of terrorism, the spread of infectious disease or other public health issues. Local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, the spread of 
infectious disease or other public health issues, recessions, or other events could have 
a significant impact on the Trust and its investments and could result in increased 
premiums or discounts to the Trust’s net asset value. For example, conflict, loss of 
life and disaster connected to ongoing armed conflicts between Ukraine and Russia in 
Europe and Israel and Hamas in the Middle East could have severe adverse effects on 
their respective regions, including significant adverse effects on the regional or global 
economies and the markets for certain securities.

premiums or discounts to the Trust’s net asset value. For example, conflict, loss of 
life and disaster connected to ongoing armed conflicts between Ukraine and Russia in 
Europe and Israel and Hamas in the Middle East could have severe adverse effects on 
their respective regions, including significant adverse effects on the regional or global 
economies and the markets for certain securities. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has 
resulted in sanctions against Russian governmental institutions, Russian entities, and 
Russian individuals that may result in the devaluation of Russian currency; a 
downgrade in the country’s credit rating; a freeze of Russian foreign assets; and a 
decline in the value and liquidity of Russian securities, properties, or interests. These 
Russian-related sanctions as well as the potential for military escalation and other 
corresponding events in Europe and the Middle East, and the resulting disruption of 
the Russian and Israeli economies, may cause volatility in other regional and global 
markets and may negatively impact the performance of various sectors and 
industries, as well as companies in other countries, which could have a negative 
effect on the performance of the Trust, even if the Trust does not have direct 
exposure to securities of Russian or Israeli issuers. An investment in the Trust is subject to the risks of any investment in a broadly based 
portfolio of equity securities, including the risk that the general level of stock prices 
may decline, thereby adversely affecting the value of such investment.

The financial condition of issuers of Portfolio Securities may become impaired or the 
general condition of the stock market may deteriorate, either of which may cause a 
decrease in the value of the Trust’s portfolio and thus in the value of Units. Since the 
Trust is not actively managed, the adverse financial condition of an issuer will not 
result in its elimination from the Trust’s portfolio unless such issuer is removed from 
the DJIA. Equity securities are susceptible to general stock market fluctuations and to 
volatile increases and decreases in value as market confidence in and perceptions of 
their issuers change. These investor perceptions are based on various and 
unpredictable factors, including expectations regarding government, economic, 
monetary and fiscal policies, inflation and interest rates, economic expansion or 
contraction, and global or regional political, economic and banking crises, as well as 
war, acts of terrorism and the spread of infectious disease, such as COVID-19, or 
other public health issues. An outbreak of infectious respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus known as 
COVID-19 was first detected in China in December 2019 and was declared a 
pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. The impact of COVID-
19, and other infectious disease outbreaks that may arise in the future, could 
adversely affect the economies of many nations or the entire global economy, 
individual issuers and capital markets in ways that cannot necessarily be foreseen. Public health crises caused by the COVID-19 outbreak may exacerbate other pre-
existing political, social and economic risks in certain countries or globally. These 
factors, as well as any restrictive measures instituted in order to prevent or control a 
pandemic or other public health crisis, such as the one posed by COVID-19, could 
have a material and adverse effect on the Trust’s investments.

Public health crises caused by the COVID-19 outbreak may exacerbate other pre-
existing political, social and economic risks in certain countries or globally. These 
factors, as well as any restrictive measures instituted in order to prevent or control a 
pandemic or other public health crisis, such as the one posed by COVID-19, could 
have a material and adverse effect on the Trust’s investments. Holders of common stocks of any given issuer incur more risk than holders of 
preferred stocks and debt obligations of the issuer because the rights of common 
stockholders, as owners of the issuer, generally are subordinate to the rights of 
creditors of, or holders of debt obligations or preferred stocks issued by, such issuer. Further, unlike debt securities that typically have a stated principal amount payable at 
maturity, or preferred stocks that typically have a liquidation preference and may 
have stated optional or mandatory redemption provisions, common stocks have 
neither a fixed principal amount nor a maturity. Equity securities values are subject to 
market fluctuations as long as the equity securities remain outstanding. The value of 
the Trust’s portfolio will fluctuate over the entire life of the Trust. The Trust may have significant investments in one or more specific industries or 
sectors, subjecting it to risks greater than general market risk. 35

Note 6 — Equity Investing and Market Risk – (continued) The Trust may invest a larger percentage of its assets in the securities of a few 
issuers. As a result, the Trust’s performance may be disproportionately impacted by 
the performance of relatively few securities. There can be no assurance that the issuers of Portfolio Securities will pay dividends.

As a result, the Trust’s performance may be disproportionately impacted by 
the performance of relatively few securities. There can be no assurance that the issuers of Portfolio Securities will pay dividends. Distributions generally depend upon the declaration of dividends by the issuers of 
Portfolio Securities and the declaration of such dividends generally depends upon 
various factors, including the financial condition of the issuers and general economic 
conditions. Note 7 — Subsequent Events 
The Trustee has evaluated the impact of all subsequent events on the Trust through 
the date on which the financial statements were issued and has determined that there 
were no subsequent events requiring adjustment or disclosure in the financial 
statements. 36

SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust 
Notes to Financial Statements 
October 31, 2024 
Note 1 — Organization 
SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (the “Trust”) is a unit investment 
trust created under the laws of the State of New York and registered under the 
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The Trust is an “Exchange-Traded 
Fund”, the units of which are listed on and traded on the New York Stock Exchange 
(“NYSE”) under the symbol “DIA”, and operates under an exemptive order granted 
by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The Trust was created 
to provide investors with the opportunity to purchase a security representing a 
proportionate undivided interest in a portfolio of securities consisting of substantially 
all of the component common stocks, in substantially the same weighting, which 
comprise the Dow Jones Industrial Average (the “DJIA”). Each unit of fractional 
undivided interest in the Trust is referred to as a “Unit”. The Trust commenced 
operations on January 14, 1998 upon the initial issuance of 500,000 Units (equivalent 
to ten “Creation Units” — see Note 4) in exchange for a portfolio of securities 
assembled to reflect the intended portfolio composition of the Trust. Under the Amended and Restated Standard Terms and Conditions of the Trust, as 
amended (the “Trust Agreement”), PDR Services, LLC (the “Sponsor”) and State 
Street Global Advisors Trust Company (the “Trustee”) are indemnified against 
certain liabilities arising out of the performance of their duties to the Trust. Additionally, in the normal course of business, the Trust enters into contracts that 
contain general indemnification clauses. The Trust’s maximum exposure under these 
arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made 
against the Trust that have not yet occurred. However, based on experience, the 
Trustee expects the risk of material loss to be remote.

The Trust’s maximum exposure under these 
arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made 
against the Trust that have not yet occurred. However, based on experience, the 
Trustee expects the risk of material loss to be remote. The Sponsor is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Intercontinental Exchange, 
Inc. (“ICE”). ICE is a publicly-traded entity, trading on the NYSE under the symbol 
“ICE.” Note 2 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the 
Trustee (who is responsible for the preparation of the Trust’s financial statements) in 
the preparation of the Trust’s financial statements: 
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted 
accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) requires the Trustee to make estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Trust is an 
investment company under U.S. GAAP and follows the accounting and reporting 
guidance applicable to investment companies. 27

Note 2 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – (continued) 
Security Valuation 
The Trust’s investments are valued at fair value each day that the NYSE is open and, 
for financial reporting purposes, as of the report date should the reporting period end 
on a day that the NYSE is not open. Fair value is generally defined as the price a fund 
would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction 
between market participants at the measurement date. By its nature, a fair value price 
is a good faith estimate of the valuation in a current sale and may not reflect an actual 
market price.

Fair value is generally defined as the price a fund 
would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction 
between market participants at the measurement date. By its nature, a fair value price 
is a good faith estimate of the valuation in a current sale and may not reflect an actual 
market price. The investments of the Trust are valued pursuant to the policy and 
procedures developed by the Oversight Committee of the Trustee (the “Committee”). The Committee provides oversight of the valuation of investments for the Trust. Valuation techniques used to value the Trust’s equity investments are as follows: 
Equity investments (including preferred stocks) traded on a recognized securities 
exchange for which market quotations are readily available are valued at the last sale 
price or official closing price, as applicable, on the primary market or exchange on 
which they trade. Equity investments traded on a recognized exchange for which 
there were no sales on that day are valued at the last published sale price or at fair 
value. In the event that prices or quotations are not readily available or that the application 
of these valuation methods results in a price for an investment that is deemed to be 
not representative of the fair value of such investment, fair value will be determined 
in good faith by the Committee, in accordance with the valuation policy and 
procedures approved by the Trustee. Fair value pricing could result in a difference between the prices used to calculate the 
Trust’s net asset value (“NAV”) and the prices used by the Trust’s underlying index, 
the DJIA, which in turn could result in a difference between the Trust’s performance 
and the performance of the DJIA.

and the performance of the DJIA. The Trustee values the Trust’s assets and liabilities at fair value using a hierarchy that 
prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques, giving the highest priority to readily 
available unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
(Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 
measurements) when market prices are not readily available or reliable. The 
categorization of a value determined for an investment within the hierarchy is based 
upon the pricing transparency of the investment and is not necessarily an indication 
of the risk associated with the investment. 28

Note 2 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – (continued) The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: 
• Level 1 — Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or 
liabilities; 
• Level 2 — Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are 
observable for the assets or liabilities either directly or indirectly, including 
quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices 
for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not considered 
to be active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset 
or liability (such as exchange rates, financing terms, interest rates, yield 
curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and default 
rates) or other market-corroborated inputs; and 
• Level 3 — Unobservable inputs for the assets or liabilities, including the 
Committee’s assumptions used in determining the fair value of investments. Investment Transactions and Income Recognition 
Investment transactions are accounted for on the trade date for financial reporting 
purposes. Dividend income and capital gain distributions, if any, are recognized on 
the ex-dividend date, or when the information becomes available, net of any foreign 
taxes withheld at source, if any. Non-cash dividends received in the form of stock, if 
any, are recorded as dividend income at fair value. Realized gains and losses from the 
sale or disposition of investments are determined using the identified cost method.

Non-cash dividends received in the form of stock, if 
any, are recorded as dividend income at fair value. Realized gains and losses from the 
sale or disposition of investments are determined using the identified cost method. Distributions 
The Trust declares and distributes dividends from net investment income, if any, to 
its holders of Units (“Unitholders”), monthly. Capital gain distributions, if any, are 
generally declared and paid annually. Additional distributions may be paid by the 
Trust to avoid imposition of federal income and excise tax on any remaining 
undistributed net investment income and capital gains. The amount and character of 
income and gains to be distributed are determined in accordance with federal tax 
regulations which may differ from net investment income and realized gains 
recognized for U.S. GAAP purposes. Equalization 
The Trustee follows the accounting practice known as “Equalization” by which a 
portion of the proceeds from sales and costs of reacquiring the Trust’s Units, 
equivalent on a per Unit basis to the amount of distributable net investment income 
on the date of the transaction, is credited or charged to undistributed net investment 
income. As a result, undistributed net investment income per Unit is unaffected by

Amounts related to Equalization can be 
found on the Statements of Changes in Net Assets. Federal Income Taxes 
For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Trust has qualified as a “regulated 
investment company” under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as 
amended (a “RIC”), and intends to continue to qualify as a RIC. As a RIC, the Trust 
will generally not be subject to U.S. federal income tax for any taxable year on 
income, including net capital gains, that it distributes to its Unitholders, provided that 
it distributes on a timely basis at least 90% of its “investment company taxable 
income” determined prior to the deduction for dividends paid by the Trust (generally, 
its taxable income other than net capital gain) for such taxable year. In addition, 
provided that the Trust distributes substantially all of its ordinary income and capital 
gains during each calendar year, the Trust will not be subject to U.S. federal excise 
tax. Income and capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with U.S. 
federal income tax principles, which may differ from U.S. GAAP. These book-tax 
differences are primarily due to differing treatments for in-kind transactions and 
losses deferred due to wash sales. U.S. GAAP requires the evaluation of tax positions taken in the course of preparing 
the Trust’s tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are more likely than not 
to be sustained by the applicable tax authority. For U.S. GAAP purposes, the Trust 
recognizes the tax benefits of uncertain tax positions only when the position is more 
likely than not to be sustained, assuming examination by tax authorities. The Trustee has reviewed the Trust’s tax positions for the open tax years as of 
October 31, 2024 and has determined that no provision for income tax is required in 
the Trust’s financial statements.

For U.S. GAAP purposes, the Trust 
recognizes the tax benefits of uncertain tax positions only when the position is more 
likely than not to be sustained, assuming examination by tax authorities. The Trustee has reviewed the Trust’s tax positions for the open tax years as of 
October 31, 2024 and has determined that no provision for income tax is required in 
the Trust’s financial statements. Generally, the Trust’s tax returns for the prior three 
fiscal years remain subject to examinations by the Trust’s major tax jurisdictions, 
which include the United States of America, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts 
and the State of New York. The Trustee has the Trust recognize interest and 
penalties, if any, related to tax liabilities as income tax expense in the Statements of 
Operations. There were no such expenses for the year ended October 31, 2024. No income tax returns are currently under examination. The Trustee has analyzed the 
relevant tax laws and regulations and their application to the Trust’s facts and 
circumstances and does not believe there are any uncertain tax positions that require 
recognition of any tax liabilities. Any potential tax liability is also subject to ongoing 
interpretation of laws by taxing authorities. The tax treatment of the Trust’s 
investments may change over time based on factors including, but not limited to, new 
tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. 30

weighting structure of the DJIA. For these services, the Trustee received a fee at the 
following annual rates for the year ended October 31, 2024: 
Net asset value of the Trust 
Fee as a percentage of net asset value of the Trust 
$0 - $499,999,999

The adjustment amount (the “Adjustment Amount”) is the sum of (a) the excess or 
deficiency of transaction fees received by the Trustee, less the expenses incurred in 
processing orders for the creation and redemption of Units and (b) the amounts 
earned by the Trustee with respect to the cash held by the Trustee for the benefit of 
the Trust. During the year ended October 31, 2024, the Adjustment Amount reduced the 
Trustee’s fee by $3,398,281. The Adjustment Amount included an excess of net 
transaction fees from processing orders of $850,473 and a Trustee earnings credit of 
$2,547,808.

transaction fees from processing orders of $850,473 and a Trustee earnings credit of 
$2,547,808. In accordance with the Trust Agreement and under the terms of an exemptive order 
issued by the SEC, dated December 30, 1997, the Sponsor is reimbursed by the Trust 
for certain expenses up to a maximum of 0.20% of the Trust’s NAV on an annualized 
basis. The expenses reimbursed to the Sponsor for the years ended October 31, 2024, 
2023 and 2022, did not exceed 0.20% per annum. The licensing and marketing fee 
disclosed below are subject to both the reimbursement from the Trust to the Sponsor 
and expense limitation of 0.20% of the Trust’s NAV for the years ended October 31, 
2024, 2023, and 2022. The Trust reimbursed the Sponsor for $505,727, $296,884 and 
$452,150 of legal fees for the years ended October 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022,

grants SSGA FD, an affiliate of the Trustee, a license to use the DJIA and to use 
certain trade names and trademarks of S&P OPCO in connection with the Trust. The

License Agreement may be amended without the consent of any of the owners of 
beneficial interests of Units. The License Agreement automatically renews for 
successive annual periods, unless terminated in accordance with its terms. Pursuant to 
such arrangements and in accordance with the Trust Agreement, the Trust reimburses 
the Sponsor for payment of fees under the License Agreement to S&P OPCO equal 
to 0.05% on the first $1 billion of the then rolling average asset balance and 0.04% on 
any excess rolling average asset balance over and above $1 billion. The minimum 
annual license fee for the Trust is $1 million. The Sponsor has entered into an agreement with the Marketing Agent pursuant to 
which the Marketing Agent has agreed to market and promote the Trust. The 
Marketing Agent is reimbursed by the Sponsor for the expenses it incurs for 
providing such services out of amounts that the Trust reimburses the Sponsor. Expenses incurred by the Marketing Agent include, but are not limited to: printing 
and distribution of marketing materials describing the Trust, associated legal, 
consulting, advertising and marketing costs and other out-of-pocket expenses.

Marketing Agent is reimbursed by the Sponsor for the expenses it incurs for 
providing such services out of amounts that the Trust reimburses the Sponsor. Expenses incurred by the Marketing Agent include, but are not limited to: printing 
and distribution of marketing materials describing the Trust, associated legal, 
consulting, advertising and marketing costs and other out-of-pocket expenses. ALPS Distributors, Inc. (the “Distributor”) serves as the distributor of the Units. The 
Sponsor pays the Distributor for its services a flat annual fee of $35,000, and the 
Trust does not reimburse the Sponsor for this fee. Note 4 — Unitholder Transactions 
Units are issued and redeemed by the Trust only in Creation Unit size aggregations of 
50,000 Units. Such transactions are only permitted on an in-kind basis, with a 
separate cash payment that is equivalent to the undistributed net investment income 
per Unit (income equalization) and a balancing cash component to equate the 
transaction to the NAV per Unit of the Trust on the transaction date. There is a 
transaction fee payable to the Trustee in connection with each creation and 
redemption of Creation Units made through the clearing process (the “Transaction 
Fee”). The Transaction Fee is non-refundable, regardless of the NAV of the Trust. The Transaction Fee is the lesser of $1,000 or 0.10% (10 basis points) of the value of 
one Creation Unit at the time of creation per participating party per day, regardless of 
the number of Creation Units created or redeemed on such day. The Transaction Fee 
is currently $1,000. For creations and redemptions outside the clearing process, 
including orders from a participating party restricted from engaging in transactions in 
one or more of the common stocks that are included in the DJIA, an additional 
amount not to exceed three (3) times the Transaction Fee applicable for one Creation 
Unit is charged per Creation Unit per day.

Note 5 — Investment Transactions For the year ended October 31, 2024, the Trust had in-kind contributions, in-kind 
redemptions, purchases and sales of investment securities of $27,939,187,281, 
$26,902,621,010, $1,076,661,743, and $1,077,829,829, respectively. Net realized 
gain (loss) on investment transactions in the Statement of Operations includes net 
gains resulting from in-kind transactions of $3,340,262,554. Note 6 — Equity Investing and Market Risk 
An investment in the Trust involves risks similar to those of investing in any fund of 
equity securities, such as market fluctuations caused by such factors as economic and 
political developments, changes in interest rates, perceived trends in securities prices, 
war, acts of terrorism, the spread of infectious disease or other public health issues. Local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, the spread of 
infectious disease or other public health issues, recessions, or other events could have 
a significant impact on the Trust and its investments and could result in increased 
premiums or discounts to the Trust’s net asset value. For example, conflict, loss of 
life and disaster connected to ongoing armed conflicts between Ukraine and Russia in 
Europe and Israel and Hamas in the Middle East could have severe adverse effects on 
their respective regions, including significant adverse effects on the regional or global 
economies and the markets for certain securities.

resulted in sanctions against Russian governmental institutions, Russian entities, and 
Russian individuals that may result in the devaluation of Russian currency; a 
downgrade in the country’s credit rating; a freeze of Russian foreign assets; and a 
decline in the value and liquidity of Russian securities, properties, or interests. These 
Russian-related sanctions as well as the potential for military escalation and other 
corresponding events in Europe and the Middle East, and the resulting disruption of 
the Russian and Israeli economies, may cause volatility in other regional and global 
markets and may negatively impact the performance of various sectors and 
industries, as well as companies in other countries, which could have a negative 
effect on the performance of the Trust, even if the Trust does not have direct 
exposure to securities of Russian or Israeli issuers. An investment in the Trust is subject to the risks of any investment in a broadly based 
portfolio of equity securities, including the risk that the general level of stock prices 
may decline, thereby adversely affecting the value of such investment.

Trust is not actively managed, the adverse financial condition of an issuer will not 
result in its elimination from the Trust’s portfolio unless such issuer is removed from

volatile increases and decreases in value as market confidence in and perceptions of 
their issuers change. These investor perceptions are based on various and 
unpredictable factors, including expectations regarding government, economic, 
monetary and fiscal policies, inflation and interest rates, economic expansion or 
contraction, and global or regional political, economic and banking crises, as well as 
war, acts of terrorism and the spread of infectious disease, such as COVID-19, or 
other public health issues. An outbreak of infectious respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus known as 
COVID-19 was first detected in China in December 2019 and was declared a 
pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. The impact of COVID-
19, and other infectious disease outbreaks that may arise in the future, could 
adversely affect the economies of many nations or the entire global economy, 
individual issuers and capital markets in ways that cannot necessarily be foreseen. Public health crises caused by the COVID-19 outbreak may exacerbate other pre-
existing political, social and economic risks in certain countries or globally. These 
factors, as well as any restrictive measures instituted in order to prevent or control a 
pandemic or other public health crisis, such as the one posed by COVID-19, could 
have a material and adverse effect on the Trust’s investments.

factors, as well as any restrictive measures instituted in order to prevent or control a 
pandemic or other public health crisis, such as the one posed by COVID-19, could 
have a material and adverse effect on the Trust’s investments. Holders of common stocks of any given issuer incur more risk than holders of 
preferred stocks and debt obligations of the issuer because the rights of common 
stockholders, as owners of the issuer, generally are subordinate to the rights of 
creditors of, or holders of debt obligations or preferred stocks issued by, such issuer. Further, unlike debt securities that typically have a stated principal amount payable at 
maturity, or preferred stocks that typically have a liquidation preference and may 
have stated optional or mandatory redemption provisions, common stocks have 
neither a fixed principal amount nor a maturity. Equity securities values are subject to 
market fluctuations as long as the equity securities remain outstanding. The value of 
the Trust’s portfolio will fluctuate over the entire life of the Trust. The Trust may have significant investments in one or more specific industries or 
sectors, subjecting it to risks greater than general market risk. 35

Portfolio Securities and the declaration of such dividends generally depends upon 
various factors, including the financial condition of the issuers and general economic 
conditions. Note 7 — Subsequent Events 
The Trustee has evaluated the impact of all subsequent events on the Trust through 
the date on which the financial statements were issued and has determined that there 
were no subsequent events requiring adjustment or disclosure in the financial

ORGANIZATION OF THE TRUST 
The Trust is a unit investment trust that issues Units. The Trust is organized under 
New York law and is governed by a trust agreement between the Trustee and the 
Sponsor, dated as of January 1, 1998 and effective as of January 13, 1998, as 
amended (the “Trust Agreement”). The Trust is an investment company registered 
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”). Units 
represent an undivided ownership interest in Portfolio Securities of the Trust. The Trust has a specified lifetime term. The Trust is scheduled to terminate on the 
first to occur of (a) January 14, 2123 or (b) the date 20 years after the death of the last 
survivor of fifteen persons named in the Trust Agreement, the oldest of whom was 
born in 1994 and the youngest of whom was born in 1997. Upon termination, the 
Trust may be liquidated and pro rata Units of the assets of the Trust, net of certain 
fees and expenses, distributed to holders of Units. PURCHASES AND REDEMPTIONS OF CREATION UNITS 
The Trust, a registered investment company, is an exchange traded fund or “ETF.” The Trust continuously issues and redeems “in-kind” its Units only in specified large 
lots of 50,000 Units or multiples thereof, which are referred to as “Creation Units,” at 
their once-daily NAV. Units are listed individually for trading on the Exchange at 
prices established throughout the trading day, like any other listed equity security 
trading on the Exchange in the secondary market. ALPS Distributors, Inc., the distributor of the Trust (the “Distributor”), acts as 
underwriter of Units on an agency basis. The Distributor maintains records of the 
Creation Unit orders placed with it and the confirmations of acceptance and furnishes 
confirmations of acceptance of the orders to those placing such orders. The 
Distributor also is responsible for delivering a prospectus to authorized participants 
creating Units.

composition and weighting to Index Securities, and a cash payment in an amount 
equal to the Dividend Equivalent Payment (as defined below), plus or minus the 
Balancing Amount (as defined below in “Portfolio Adjustments — Adjustments to 
the Portfolio Deposit”). “Dividend Equivalent Payment” is an amount equal, on a per 
Creation Unit basis, to the dividends on the Portfolio (with ex-dividend dates within 
the accumulation period), net of expenses and accrued liabilities for such period 
(including, without limitation, (i) taxes or other governmental charges against the 
Trust not previously deducted, if any, (ii) accrued fees of the Trustee and (iii) other 
expenses of the Trust (including legal and auditing expenses) not previously 
deducted), calculated as if all of the Portfolio Securities had been held for the entire 
accumulation period for such distribution. The Dividend Equivalent Payment and the 
Balancing Amount collectively are referred to as the “Cash Component” and the 
deposit of a portfolio of securities and the Cash Component collectively are referred 
to as a “Portfolio Deposit.” Persons placing creation orders must deposit Portfolio 
Deposits either (i) through the CNS clearing process of NSCC (the “Clearing 
Process”) or (ii) with the Trustee outside the Clearing Process (i.e., through the 
facilities of DTC). The Distributor will reject any order that is not submitted in proper form.

Closing Time (as defined below) on such Transmittal Date and (b) all other 
procedures set forth in the Participant Agreement are properly followed. The 
Transaction Fee (as defined below) is charged at the time of creation of a Creation 
Unit, and an additional amount not to exceed three (3) times the Transaction Fee 
applicable for one Creation Unit is charged for creations outside the Clearing 
Process, in part due to the increased expense associated with settlement. The Trustee, at the direction of the Sponsor, may increase, reduce or waive the 
Transaction Fee (and/or the additional amounts charged in connection with creations 
and/or redemptions outside the Clearing Process) for certain lot-size creations and/or 
redemptions of Creation Units. The Sponsor has the right to vary the lot-size of 
Creation Units subject to such an increase, a reduction or waiver. The existence of 
any such variation shall be disclosed in the then-current prospectus. The DJIA is a price-weighted stock index; that is, the component stocks of the DJIA 
are represented in exactly equal share amounts and therefore are accorded relative 
importance in the DJIA based on their prices. The shares of common stock of the 
stock portion of a Portfolio Deposit on any date of deposit will reflect the 
composition of the component stocks of the DJIA on such day. The portfolio of Index 
Securities that is the basis for a Portfolio Deposit varies as changes are made in the

composition of the component stocks of the DJIA on such day. The portfolio of Index 
Securities that is the basis for a Portfolio Deposit varies as changes are made in the

of changes to the identity or weighting of any Index Security resulting from a change 
to the DJIA by making a corresponding adjustment to the Portfolio Deposit within 
one (1) Business Day before or after the day on which the change to the DJIA takes 
effect. The Trustee makes available to NSCC before the commencement of trading on each 
day that the New York Stock Exchange LLC (the “NYSE”) is open for business (a 
“Business Day”) a list of the names and required number of shares of each of the 
Index Securities in the current Portfolio Deposit as well as the amount of the 
Dividend Equivalent Payment for the previous Business Day. Under certain 
extraordinary circumstances which may make it impossible for the Trustee to provide 
such information to NSCC on a given Business Day, NSCC will use the information 
regarding the identity of the Index Securities of the Portfolio Deposit on the previous 
Business Day. The Sponsor makes available every 15 seconds throughout the trading 
day at the Exchange a number representing, on a per Unit basis, the sum of the 
Dividend Equivalent Payment effective through and including the previous Business 
Day, plus the current value of the securities portion of a Portfolio Deposit as in effect 
on such day (which value occasionally may include a cash-in-lieu amount to 
compensate for the omission of a particular Index Security from such Portfolio 
Deposit). Such information is calculated based upon the best information available to 
the Sponsor and may be calculated by other persons designated to do so by the 
Sponsor.

Creation Units, the Trustee may permit, in lieu thereof, the cash equivalent value of 
one or more of these Index Securities to be included in the Portfolio Deposit as a part 
of the Cash Component. If a creator is restricted by regulation or otherwise from 
investing or engaging in a transaction in one or more Index Securities, the Trustee 
may permit, in lieu of the inclusion of such Index Securities in the stock portion of 
the Portfolio Deposit, the cash equivalent value of such Index Securities to be 
included in the Portfolio Deposit based on the market value of such Index Securities 
as of the closing time of the regular trading session on the NYSE (the “Closing 
Time”) (ordinarily 4:00 p.m., New York time) (the “Evaluation Time”) on the date 
such creation order is deemed received by the Distributor as part of the Cash 
Component. Procedures for Purchase of Creation Units.

Creation Units and must be received by the Trustee by no later than the Closing Time 
(ordinarily 4:00 p.m., New York time) in each case on the date such order is placed, 
in order for creation to be effected based on the NAV of the Trust as determined on 
such date. Orders must be transmitted by telephone, through the Internet or by other 
transmission method(s) acceptable to the Distributor and the Trustee, pursuant to 
procedures set forth in the Participant Agreement and/or described in this prospectus. 43 In addition, orders submitted through the Internet must also comply with the terms 
and provisions of the State Street Fund Connect Buy-Side User Agreement and other 
applicable agreements and documents, including but not limited to the applicable 
Fund Connect User Guide or successor documents. An affiliate of State Street Global 
Advisors Funds Distributors, LLC (“SSGA FD”) may assist Authorized Participants 
in assembling shares to purchase Creation Units (or upon redemption), for which it

than the NAV of the Units on the date the order is placed in proper form, because in 
addition to available Index Securities, cash collateral must be deposited with the 
Trustee in an amount equal to the sum of (a) the Cash Component, plus (b) 115% of 
the market value of the undelivered Index Securities (“Additional Cash Deposit”). The Trustee holds such Additional Cash Deposit as collateral in an account separate 
and apart from the Trust. An order will be deemed received on the Business Day on 
which it is placed so long as (a) the order is placed in proper form before the Closing 
Time on such Business Day and (b) federal funds in the appropriate amount are 
deposited with the Trustee by 1:00 p.m., New York time, or such other time as

must be deposited with the Trustee, pending delivery of the missing Index Securities, 
to the extent necessary to maintain the Additional Cash Deposit with the Trustee in 
an amount at least equal to 115% of the daily mark-to-market value of the missing

order is deemed received and if a mark-to-market payment is not made within one 
(1) Business Day following notification by the Distributor that such payment is 
required, the Trustee may use the Additional Cash Deposit to purchase the missing 
Index Securities. The Trustee will return any unused portion of the Additional Cash 
Deposit only once all of the missing Index Securities of the Portfolio Deposit have 
been properly received or purchased by the Trustee and deposited into the Trust. In 
addition, a Transaction Fee will be imposed in an amount not to exceed that charged 
for creations outside the Clearing Process as disclosed below. The delivery of 
Creation Units created as described above will occur no later than the prescribed 
settlement date.

Participating Party to liability for any shortfall between the cost to the Trust of 
44 
purchasing such stocks and the value of such collateral. The Participating Party is 
liable to the Trust for the costs incurred by the Trust in connection with any such 
purchases. The Trust will have no liability for any such shortfall. Acceptance of Orders of Creation Units. All questions as to the number of shares of 
each Index Security, the amount of the Cash Component and the validity, form, 
eligibility (including time of receipt) and acceptance for deposit of any Index 
Securities to be delivered are resolved by the Trustee. The Trustee may reject a 
creation order if (a) the depositor or a group of depositors, upon obtaining the Units 
ordered, would own 80% or more of the current outstanding Units; (b) the Portfolio 
Deposit is not in proper form; (c) acceptance of the Portfolio Deposit would have 
certain adverse tax consequences; (d) the acceptance of the Portfolio Deposit would, 
in the opinion of counsel, be unlawful; (e) the acceptance of the Portfolio Deposit 
would otherwise have an adverse effect on the Trust or the rights of Beneficial 
Owners; or (f) circumstances outside the control of the Trustee make it for all

incur any liability for the failure to give any such notification. Creation Transaction Fee. The transaction fee payable to the Trustee in connection 
with each creation and redemption of Creation Units made through the Clearing 
Process (the “Transaction Fee”) is non-refundable, regardless of the NAV of the 
Trust. The Transaction Fee is the lesser of $1,000 or 0.10% (10 basis points) of the 
value of one Creation Unit at the time of creation (“10 Basis Point Limit”) per 
Participating Party per day, regardless of the number of Creation Units created or 
redeemed on such day. The Transaction Fee is currently $1,000.

through the Clearing Process must be delivered through a Participating Party that has 
executed a Participant Agreement. The Participant Agreement authorizes the Trustee 
to transmit to the Participating Party such trade instructions as are necessary to effect 
the creation order. Pursuant to the trade instructions from the Trustee to NSCC, the 
Participating Party agrees to transfer, by the first day during which NSCC is open for 
business (each such day, an “NSCC Business Day”), the requisite Index Securities (or 
contracts to purchase such Index Securities that are expected to be delivered through 
the Clearing Process in a “regular way” manner by the first such NSCC Business 
Day) and the Cash Component to the Trustee, together with such additional 
information as may be required by the Trustee. Placement of Creation Orders Outside Clearing Process. Creation Units created 
outside the Clearing Process must be delivered through a DTC Participant that has 
45 
executed a Participant Agreement and has stated in its order that it is not using the 
Clearing Process and that creation will instead be effected through a transfer of 
stocks and cash.

Placement of Creation Orders Outside Clearing Process. Creation Units created 
outside the Clearing Process must be delivered through a DTC Participant that has 
45 
executed a Participant Agreement and has stated in its order that it is not using the 
Clearing Process and that creation will instead be effected through a transfer of 
stocks and cash. The requisite number of Index Securities must be delivered through 
DTC to the account of the Trustee by no later than 1:00 p.m., New York time, on 
settlement date. The Trustee, through the Federal Reserve Bank wire transfer system, 
must receive the Cash Component no later than 1:00 p.m., New York time, on 
settlement date. If the Trustee does not receive both the requisite Index Securities and 
the Cash Component in a timely fashion, the order may be cancelled. Upon written 
notice to the Distributor, the cancelled order may be resubmitted the following 
Business Day using a Portfolio Deposit as newly constituted to reflect the current 
NAV of the Trust. The delivery of Units so created will occur no later than the 
prescribed settlement date. Shortened Settlement Cycles. Shortened settlement cycles are expected to be 
available, through which creation unit transactions can be settled on the trade date, 
pursuant to procedures established by NSCC and the Trustee. Authorized Participants 
wishing to use such shortened settlement cycles should contact the Trustee. Pursuant 
to this process, the Cash Component required to be paid by the Authorized 
Participant will be estimated prior to settlement and finalized after settlement 
following the calculation of the Trust’s NAV on that day. The Trust retains a risk of 
loss if an Authorized Participant defaults on its obligation to pay to the Trust any 
additional Cash Component it owes.

Units may be redeemed in-kind only in Creation Units at their NAV determined after 
receipt of a redemption request in proper form by the Distributor and Trustee through 
the Depository and relevant DTC Participant and only on a Business Day. Units are 
not redeemable for cash. EXCEPT UPON LIQUIDATION OF THE TRUST, THE 
TRUST WILL NOT REDEEM UNITS IN AMOUNTS LESS THAN CREATION 
UNITS. Investors must accumulate enough Units in the secondary market to 
constitute a Creation Unit in order to have such Units redeemed by the Trust, and 
Units may be redeemed only by or through an Authorized Participant. There can be 
no assurance, however, that there will be sufficient liquidity in the public trading 
market at any time to permit assembly of a Creation Unit. Investors should expect to 
incur brokerage and other costs in connection with assembling a sufficient number of 
Units to constitute a redeemable Creation Unit. With respect to the Trust, the Trustee, through NSCC, makes available immediately 
prior to the commencement of trading on the NYSE (currently 9:30 a.m., Eastern 
time) on each Business Day, a list of the names and required number of shares of 
each of the Index Securities and the amount of the Dividend Equivalent Payment for 
the previous Business Day that will be applicable (subject to possible amendment or 
correction) to redemption requests received in proper form (as discussed below) on 
that day. Index Securities received on redemption may not be identical to the stock 
portion of the Portfolio Deposit which is applicable to purchases of Creation Units.

with a Participating Party (for redemptions through the Clearing Process) or DTC 
Participant (for redemptions outside the Clearing Process), as applicable, in the form 
required by such Participating Party or DTC Participant. A particular broker may not 
have executed a Participant Agreement, and redemption orders may have to be placed 
by the broker through a Participating Party or DTC Participant who has executed a 
Participant Agreement. At any given time, there may be only a limited number of 
broker-dealers that have executed a Participant Agreement.

sufficient time to permit (a) proper submission of the order by a Participating Party or 
DTC Participant to the Distributor and the Trustee and (b) the receipt by the Trustee 
of the Units to be redeemed and any Excess Cash Amounts (as defined below) in a 
timely manner. Orders for redemption effected outside the Clearing Process are likely 
to require transmittal by the relevant DTC Participant(s) earlier on the Transmittal 
Date than orders effected using the Clearing Process. These deadlines vary by 
institution. Persons redeeming outside the Clearing Process are required to transfer 
Units through DTC and Excess Cash Amounts, if any, through the Federal Reserve 
Bank wire transfer system in a timely manner. An Authorized Participant submitting a redemption request is deemed to represent to 
the Distributor and Trustee that it is in compliance with the requirements set forth in 
the Participant Agreement. Each of the Distributor and Trustee reserves the right to 
verify these representations at its discretion, but will typically require verification 
with respect to a redemption request in connection with higher levels of redemption 
activity and/or short interest in the Trust. If the Authorized Participant, upon receipt 
of a verification request, does not provide sufficient verification of its representations 
as determined by the Distributor or Trustee, the redemption request will not be 
considered to have been received in proper form and may be rejected. Requests for redemption may be made on any Business Day to the Distributor and 
the Trustee.

Unit. The Trustee, upon the request of a redeeming Authorized Participant, may elect to 
redeem Creation Units in whole or in part by providing such redeemer with a 
portfolio of stocks differing in exact composition from Index Securities but not 
differing in NAV from the then-current Portfolio Deposit. Such a redemption is likely 
48 
to be made only if it were determined that it would be appropriate in order to 
maintain the Trust’s correspondence to the composition and weighting of the DJIA.

differing in NAV from the then-current Portfolio Deposit. Such a redemption is likely

to be made only if it were determined that it would be appropriate in order to 
maintain the Trust’s correspondence to the composition and weighting of the DJIA. The Trustee may sell Portfolio Securities to obtain sufficient cash proceeds to deliver 
to the redeeming Beneficial Owner. To the extent cash proceeds are received by the 
Trustee in excess of the required amount, such cash proceeds shall be held by the 
Trustee and applied in accordance with the guidelines applicable to residual cash set 
forth under “Portfolio Adjustments.” All redemption orders must be transmitted to the Trustee by telephone, through the 
Internet or by other transmission method(s) acceptable to the Distributor and the 
Trustee, pursuant to procedures set forth in the Participant Agreement and/or 
described in this prospectus, so as to be received by the Distributor and the Trustee 
not later than the Closing Time on the Transmittal Date. In addition, orders submitted 
through the Internet must also comply with the terms and provisions of the State 
Street Fund Connect Buy-Side User Agreement and other applicable agreements and 
documents, including but not limited to the applicable Fund Connect User Guide or 
successor documents. Severe economic or market disruption or changes, or telephone 
or other communication failure, may impede the ability to reach the Distributor, the

Date, and the requisite Units are delivered to the Trustee prior to DTC Cut-Off Time 
(as defined below in “Purchases and Redemptions of Creation Units — Redemption 
— Placement of Redemption Orders Outside Clearing Process”), then the value of 
the stocks and the Cash Redemption Payment to be delivered to the Beneficial Owner

a Transmittal Date but the requisite Units are not delivered by DTC Cut-Off Time, 
the stocks and Cash Redemption Payment will be delivered upon receipt of the 
requisite Units.

ORGANIZATION OF THE TRUST 
The Trust is a unit investment trust that issues Units. The Trust is organized under 
New York law and is governed by a trust agreement between the Trustee and the 
Sponsor, dated as of January 1, 1998 and effective as of January 13, 1998, as 
amended (the “Trust Agreement”). The Trust is an investment company registered 
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”). Units 
represent an undivided ownership interest in Portfolio Securities of the Trust. The Trust has a specified lifetime term. The Trust is scheduled to terminate on the 
first to occur of (a) January 14, 2123 or (b) the date 20 years after the death of the last 
survivor of fifteen persons named in the Trust Agreement, the oldest of whom was 
born in 1994 and the youngest of whom was born in 1997. Upon termination, the 
Trust may be liquidated and pro rata Units of the assets of the Trust, net of certain 
fees and expenses, distributed to holders of Units. PURCHASES AND REDEMPTIONS OF CREATION UNITS 
The Trust, a registered investment company, is an exchange traded fund or “ETF.” The Trust continuously issues and redeems “in-kind” its Units only in specified large 
lots of 50,000 Units or multiples thereof, which are referred to as “Creation Units,” at 
their once-daily NAV. Units are listed individually for trading on the Exchange at 
prices established throughout the trading day, like any other listed equity security 
trading on the Exchange in the secondary market. ALPS Distributors, Inc., the distributor of the Trust (the “Distributor”), acts as 
underwriter of Units on an agency basis. The Distributor maintains records of the 
Creation Unit orders placed with it and the confirmations of acceptance and furnishes 
confirmations of acceptance of the orders to those placing such orders. The 
Distributor also is responsible for delivering a prospectus to authorized participants 
creating Units.

The Distributor maintains records of the 
Creation Unit orders placed with it and the confirmations of acceptance and furnishes 
confirmations of acceptance of the orders to those placing such orders. The 
Distributor also is responsible for delivering a prospectus to authorized participants 
creating Units. The Distributor also maintains a record of the delivery instructions in 
response to Creation Unit orders and may provide certain other administrative 
services. For purposes of the disclosure relating to the purchase and redemption of Units 
below, the “Trustee” may refer to SSBT in its capacity as the Administrator, 
Custodian and/or Transfer Agent for the Trustee. Purchase (Creation) Before trading on the Exchange in the secondary market, Units are created at NAV in 
Creation Units. All orders for Creation Units must be placed with the Distributor as 
facilitated through the Trustee. To be eligible to place these orders, an entity or 
person must be an “Authorized Participant,” which (a) is either a “Participating 
Party” or a “DTC Participant” and (b) in each case must have executed an agreement 
with the Distributor and the Trustee (the “Participant Agreement”). The term 
“Participating Party” means a broker-dealer or other participant in the Clearing 
41 
Process (as defined below) through the Continuous Net Settlement (“CNS”) System 
of the National Securities Clearing Corporation (“NSCC”), a clearing agency 
registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), and the term 
“DTC Participant” means a participant in DTC. Payment for orders is made by 
deposits with the Trustee of a portfolio of securities, substantially similar in 
composition and weighting to Index Securities, and a cash payment in an amount 
equal to the Dividend Equivalent Payment (as defined below), plus or minus the 
Balancing Amount (as defined below in “Portfolio Adjustments — Adjustments to 
the Portfolio Deposit”).

registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), and the term 
“DTC Participant” means a participant in DTC. Payment for orders is made by 
deposits with the Trustee of a portfolio of securities, substantially similar in 
composition and weighting to Index Securities, and a cash payment in an amount 
equal to the Dividend Equivalent Payment (as defined below), plus or minus the 
Balancing Amount (as defined below in “Portfolio Adjustments — Adjustments to 
the Portfolio Deposit”). “Dividend Equivalent Payment” is an amount equal, on a per 
Creation Unit basis, to the dividends on the Portfolio (with ex-dividend dates within 
the accumulation period), net of expenses and accrued liabilities for such period 
(including, without limitation, (i) taxes or other governmental charges against the 
Trust not previously deducted, if any, (ii) accrued fees of the Trustee and (iii) other 
expenses of the Trust (including legal and auditing expenses) not previously 
deducted), calculated as if all of the Portfolio Securities had been held for the entire 
accumulation period for such distribution. The Dividend Equivalent Payment and the 
Balancing Amount collectively are referred to as the “Cash Component” and the 
deposit of a portfolio of securities and the Cash Component collectively are referred 
to as a “Portfolio Deposit.” Persons placing creation orders must deposit Portfolio 
Deposits either (i) through the CNS clearing process of NSCC (the “Clearing 
Process”) or (ii) with the Trustee outside the Clearing Process (i.e., through the 
facilities of DTC). The Distributor will reject any order that is not submitted in proper form.

Closing Time (as defined below) on such Transmittal Date and (b) all other 
procedures set forth in the Participant Agreement are properly followed. The 
Transaction Fee (as defined below) is charged at the time of creation of a Creation 
Unit, and an additional amount not to exceed three (3) times the Transaction Fee 
applicable for one Creation Unit is charged for creations outside the Clearing 
Process, in part due to the increased expense associated with settlement. The Trustee, at the direction of the Sponsor, may increase, reduce or waive the 
Transaction Fee (and/or the additional amounts charged in connection with creations 
and/or redemptions outside the Clearing Process) for certain lot-size creations and/or 
redemptions of Creation Units. The Sponsor has the right to vary the lot-size of 
Creation Units subject to such an increase, a reduction or waiver. The existence of 
any such variation shall be disclosed in the then-current prospectus. The DJIA is a price-weighted stock index; that is, the component stocks of the DJIA 
are represented in exactly equal share amounts and therefore are accorded relative 
importance in the DJIA based on their prices. The shares of common stock of the 
stock portion of a Portfolio Deposit on any date of deposit will reflect the 
composition of the component stocks of the DJIA on such day. The portfolio of Index 
Securities that is the basis for a Portfolio Deposit varies as changes are made in the

of changes to the identity or weighting of any Index Security resulting from a change 
to the DJIA by making a corresponding adjustment to the Portfolio Deposit within 
one (1) Business Day before or after the day on which the change to the DJIA takes 
effect. The Trustee makes available to NSCC before the commencement of trading on each 
day that the New York Stock Exchange LLC (the “NYSE”) is open for business (a 
“Business Day”) a list of the names and required number of shares of each of the 
Index Securities in the current Portfolio Deposit as well as the amount of the 
Dividend Equivalent Payment for the previous Business Day. Under certain 
extraordinary circumstances which may make it impossible for the Trustee to provide 
such information to NSCC on a given Business Day, NSCC will use the information 
regarding the identity of the Index Securities of the Portfolio Deposit on the previous 
Business Day. The Sponsor makes available every 15 seconds throughout the trading 
day at the Exchange a number representing, on a per Unit basis, the sum of the 
Dividend Equivalent Payment effective through and including the previous Business 
Day, plus the current value of the securities portion of a Portfolio Deposit as in effect 
on such day (which value occasionally may include a cash-in-lieu amount to 
compensate for the omission of a particular Index Security from such Portfolio 
Deposit). Such information is calculated based upon the best information available to

In 
addition, a Transaction Fee will be imposed in an amount not to exceed that charged 
for creations outside the Clearing Process as disclosed below. The delivery of 
Creation Units created as described above will occur no later than the prescribed 
settlement date. The Participant Agreement for any Participating Party intending to 
follow these procedures contains terms and conditions permitting the Trustee to buy 
the missing portion(s) of a Portfolio Deposit at any time and will subject the 
Participating Party to liability for any shortfall between the cost to the Trust of 
44 
purchasing such stocks and the value of such collateral. The Participating Party is 
liable to the Trust for the costs incurred by the Trust in connection with any such 
purchases. The Trust will have no liability for any such shortfall. Acceptance of Orders of Creation Units. All questions as to the number of shares of 
each Index Security, the amount of the Cash Component and the validity, form, 
eligibility (including time of receipt) and acceptance for deposit of any Index 
Securities to be delivered are resolved by the Trustee. The Trustee may reject a 
creation order if (a) the depositor or a group of depositors, upon obtaining the Units 
ordered, would own 80% or more of the current outstanding Units; (b) the Portfolio 
Deposit is not in proper form; (c) acceptance of the Portfolio Deposit would have 
certain adverse tax consequences; (d) the acceptance of the Portfolio Deposit would, 
in the opinion of counsel, be unlawful; (e) the acceptance of the Portfolio Deposit 
would otherwise have an adverse effect on the Trust or the rights of Beneficial 
Owners; or (f) circumstances outside the control of the Trustee make it for all 
practical purposes impossible to process creations of Units.

Sponsor are under no duty to give notification of any defects or irregularities in the 
delivery of Portfolio Deposits or any component thereof and neither of them will 
incur any liability for the failure to give any such notification. Creation Transaction Fee. The transaction fee payable to the Trustee in connection 
with each creation and redemption of Creation Units made through the Clearing 
Process (the “Transaction Fee”) is non-refundable, regardless of the NAV of the 
Trust. The Transaction Fee is the lesser of $1,000 or 0.10% (10 basis points) of the 
value of one Creation Unit at the time of creation (“10 Basis Point Limit”) per 
Participating Party per day, regardless of the number of Creation Units created or 
redeemed on such day. The Transaction Fee is currently $1,000.

Securities, an additional amount not to exceed three (3) times the Transaction Fee 
applicable for one Creation Unit is charged per Creation Unit per day. Placement of Creation Orders Using Clearing Process. Creation Units created 
through the Clearing Process must be delivered through a Participating Party that has 
executed a Participant Agreement. The Participant Agreement authorizes the Trustee 
to transmit to the Participating Party such trade instructions as are necessary to effect 
the creation order. Pursuant to the trade instructions from the Trustee to NSCC, the 
Participating Party agrees to transfer, by the first day during which NSCC is open for 
business (each such day, an “NSCC Business Day”), the requisite Index Securities (or 
contracts to purchase such Index Securities that are expected to be delivered through 
the Clearing Process in a “regular way” manner by the first such NSCC Business 
Day) and the Cash Component to the Trustee, together with such additional 
information as may be required by the Trustee. Placement of Creation Orders Outside Clearing Process. Creation Units created 
outside the Clearing Process must be delivered through a DTC Participant that has 
45 
executed a Participant Agreement and has stated in its order that it is not using the 
Clearing Process and that creation will instead be effected through a transfer of 
stocks and cash.

Clearing Process and that creation will instead be effected through a transfer of

DTC to the account of the Trustee by no later than 1:00 p.m., New York time, on 
settlement date. The Trustee, through the Federal Reserve Bank wire transfer system, 
must receive the Cash Component no later than 1:00 p.m., New York time, on 
settlement date. If the Trustee does not receive both the requisite Index Securities and 
the Cash Component in a timely fashion, the order may be cancelled. Upon written 
notice to the Distributor, the cancelled order may be resubmitted the following 
Business Day using a Portfolio Deposit as newly constituted to reflect the current 
NAV of the Trust. The delivery of Units so created will occur no later than the 
prescribed settlement date. Shortened Settlement Cycles. Shortened settlement cycles are expected to be 
available, through which creation unit transactions can be settled on the trade date, 
pursuant to procedures established by NSCC and the Trustee. Authorized Participants 
wishing to use such shortened settlement cycles should contact the Trustee. Pursuant 
to this process, the Cash Component required to be paid by the Authorized 
Participant will be estimated prior to settlement and finalized after settlement 
following the calculation of the Trust’s NAV on that day. The Trust retains a risk of 
loss if an Authorized Participant defaults on its obligation to pay to the Trust any 
additional Cash Component it owes.

constitute a Creation Unit in order to have such Units redeemed by the Trust, and 
Units may be redeemed only by or through an Authorized Participant. There can be 
no assurance, however, that there will be sufficient liquidity in the public trading 
market at any time to permit assembly of a Creation Unit. Investors should expect to 
incur brokerage and other costs in connection with assembling a sufficient number of 
Units to constitute a redeemable Creation Unit. With respect to the Trust, the Trustee, through NSCC, makes available immediately 
prior to the commencement of trading on the NYSE (currently 9:30 a.m., Eastern 
time) on each Business Day, a list of the names and required number of shares of 
each of the Index Securities and the amount of the Dividend Equivalent Payment for 
the previous Business Day that will be applicable (subject to possible amendment or 
correction) to redemption requests received in proper form (as discussed below) on 
that day. Index Securities received on redemption may not be identical to the stock

with a Participating Party (for redemptions through the Clearing Process) or DTC 
Participant (for redemptions outside the Clearing Process), as applicable, in the form 
required by such Participating Party or DTC Participant. A particular broker may not 
have executed a Participant Agreement, and redemption orders may have to be placed 
by the broker through a Participating Party or DTC Participant who has executed a 
Participant Agreement. At any given time, there may be only a limited number of 
broker-dealers that have executed a Participant Agreement. Redeemers should afford 
sufficient time to permit (a) proper submission of the order by a Participating Party or 
DTC Participant to the Distributor and the Trustee and (b) the receipt by the Trustee 
of the Units to be redeemed and any Excess Cash Amounts (as defined below) in a 
timely manner. Orders for redemption effected outside the Clearing Process are likely 
to require transmittal by the relevant DTC Participant(s) earlier on the Transmittal 
Date than orders effected using the Clearing Process. These deadlines vary by 
institution. Persons redeeming outside the Clearing Process are required to transfer 
Units through DTC and Excess Cash Amounts, if any, through the Federal Reserve 
Bank wire transfer system in a timely manner.

These deadlines vary by 
institution. Persons redeeming outside the Clearing Process are required to transfer 
Units through DTC and Excess Cash Amounts, if any, through the Federal Reserve 
Bank wire transfer system in a timely manner. An Authorized Participant submitting a redemption request is deemed to represent to 
the Distributor and Trustee that it is in compliance with the requirements set forth in 
the Participant Agreement. Each of the Distributor and Trustee reserves the right to 
verify these representations at its discretion, but will typically require verification 
with respect to a redemption request in connection with higher levels of redemption 
activity and/or short interest in the Trust. If the Authorized Participant, upon receipt 
of a verification request, does not provide sufficient verification of its representations 
as determined by the Distributor or Trustee, the redemption request will not be 
considered to have been received in proper form and may be rejected. Requests for redemption may be made on any Business Day to the Distributor and 
the Trustee. In the case of redemptions made through the Clearing Process, the 
Transaction Fee is deducted from the amount delivered to the redeemer. In the case 
of redemptions outside the Clearing Process, the Transaction Fee plus an additional 
amount not to exceed three (3) times the Transaction Fee applicable for one Creation 
Unit per Creation Unit redeemed, is deducted from the amount delivered to the 
redeemer.

including, without limitation, (i) taxes or other governmental charges against the

made through the Clearing Process will be deemed received on the Transmittal Date 
so long as (a) the order is received by the Distributor and Trustee not later than the 
Closing Time on such Transmittal Date and (b) all other procedures set forth in the 
Participant Agreement are properly followed. The order is effected based on the 
NAV of the Trust as determined as of the Evaluation Time on the Transmittal Date. A redemption order made through the Clearing Process and received by the 
Distributor and Trustee after the Closing Time will be deemed received on the next 
Business Day immediately following the Transmittal Date. The Participant 
Agreement authorizes the Trustee to transmit to NSCC on behalf of a Participating 
Party such trade instructions as are necessary to effect the Participating Party’s 
redemption order. Pursuant to such trade instructions from the Trustee to NSCC, the 
Trustee will transfer (a) the requisite stocks (or contracts to purchase such stocks, 
which are expected to be delivered in a “regular way” manner) on settlement date, 
and (b) the Cash Redemption Payment. Placement of Redemption Orders Outside Clearing Process. A DTC Participant 
who wishes to place an order for redemption of Units to be effected outside the 
Clearing Process need not be a Participating Party, but its order must state that such 
DTC Participant is not using the Clearing Process and that redemption will instead be 
effected through transfer of Units directly through DTC.

deposited with, or on behalf of, DTC. Beneficial ownership of Units is shown on the 
50 
records of DTC or the DTC Participants (owners of such beneficial interests are 
referred to herein as “Beneficial Owners”). DTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of 
New York, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within 
the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, and a “clearing agency” 
registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act 
of 1934. DTC was created to hold securities of the DTC Participants and to facilitate 
the clearance and settlement of securities transactions among the DTC Participants 
through electronic book-entry changes in their accounts, thereby eliminating the need 
for physical movement of securities certificates. DTC Participants include securities 
brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations, and certain other 
organizations. Access to the DTC system also is available to others, such as banks, 
brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial 
relationship with a DTC Participant, either directly or indirectly (“Indirect 
Participants”). Upon the settlement date of any creation, transfer or redemption of Units, DTC 
credits or debits, on its book-entry registration and transfer system, the amount of 
Units so created, transferred or redeemed to the accounts of the appropriate DTC 
Participants. The accounts to be credited and charged are designated by the Trustee to 
NSCC, in the case of a creation or redemption through the Clearing Process, or by the 
Trustee and the DTC Participants, in the case of a creation or redemption outside of 
the Clearing Process.

Participants, Indirect Participants and persons holding interests through the DTC 
Participants and Indirect Participants. Ownership of beneficial interests in Units is 
shown on, and the transfer of ownership is effected only through, records maintained 
by DTC (with respect to DTC Participants) and on the records of DTC Participants 
(with respect to Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners that are not DTC 
Participants). Beneficial Owners are expected to receive from or through the relevant 
DTC Participant a written confirmation relating to their purchase of Units. The laws 
of some jurisdictions may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical 
delivery of such securities in definitive form. Such laws may impair the ability of 
certain investors to acquire beneficial interests in Units. As long as Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC, is the registered owner of Units, 
references to the registered or record owner of Units shall mean Cede & Co. and shall 
not mean the Beneficial Owners of Units. Beneficial Owners of Units are not entitled

The Trust is not managed, and therefore the adverse financial condition of an issuer 
does not require the sale of stocks from the Portfolio. The Trustee on a non-
discretionary basis adjusts the composition of the Portfolio to conform to changes in 
the composition and/or weighting structure of Index Securities in the Index. To the 
extent that the method of determining the DJIA is changed by S&P in a manner that 
would affect the adjustments provided for herein, the Trustee and the Sponsor have 
the right to amend the Trust Agreement, without the consent of DTC or Beneficial 
Owners, to conform the adjustments to such changes and to maintain the objective of 
tracking the DJIA. The Trustee directs its stock transactions only to brokers or dealers, which may 
include affiliates of the Trustee, from whom it expects to obtain the most favorable 
prices for execution of orders. Adjustments are made more frequently in the case of 
significant changes to the DJIA. Specifically, the Trustee is required to adjust the 
composition of the Portfolio whenever there is a change in the identity of any Index 
Security (i.e., a substitution of one security for another) within three (3) Business 
Days before or after the day on which the change is scheduled to take effect.

composition of the Portfolio whenever there is a change in the identity of any Index 
Security (i.e., a substitution of one security for another) within three (3) Business 
Days before or after the day on which the change is scheduled to take effect. While 
other DJIA changes may lead to adjustments in the Portfolio, the most common 
changes are likely to occur as a result of changes in the Index Securities included in 
the DJIA and as a result of stock splits. The Trust Agreement sets forth the method of 
adjustments which may occur thereunder as a result of corporate actions to the DJIA, 
such as stock splits or changes in the identity of the component stocks. For example, in the event of an Index Security change (in which the common stock 
of one issuer held in the DJIA is replaced by the common stock of another), the 
Trustee may sell all shares of the Portfolio Security corresponding to the old Index 
Security and use the proceeds of such sale to purchase the replacement Portfolio 
Security corresponding to the new Index Security. If the share price of the removed 
Portfolio Security was higher than the price of its replacement, the Trustee will 
calculate how to allocate the proceeds of the sale of the removed Portfolio Security 
between the purchase of its replacement and purchases of additional shares of other 
Portfolio Securities so that the number of shares of each Portfolio Security after the 
transactions would be as nearly equal as practicable.

between the purchase of its replacement and purchases of additional shares of other 
Portfolio Securities so that the number of shares of each Portfolio Security after the 
transactions would be as nearly equal as practicable. If the share price of the removed 
Portfolio Security was lower than the price of its replacement, the Trustee will 
calculate the number of shares of each of the other Portfolio Securities that must be 
sold in order to purchase enough shares of the replacement Portfolio Security so that 
the number of shares of each Portfolio Security after the transactions would be as 
nearly equal as practicable. In the event of a stock split, the price weighting of the stock which is split will drop. The Trustee may make the corresponding adjustment by selling the additional shares 
of the Portfolio Security received from the stock split. The Trustee may then use the 
proceeds of the sale to buy an equal number of shares of each Portfolio Security, 
including the Portfolio Security which had just experienced a stock split. In practice, 
of course, not all the shares received in the split would be sold: enough of those 
shares would be retained to make an increase in the number of split shares equal to 
53 
the increase in the number of shares in each of the other Portfolio Securities 
purchased with the proceeds of the sale of the remaining shares resulting from such 
split.

(other than cash held temporarily due to timing differences between the sale and 
purchase of stock or cash delivered in lieu of Index Securities or undistributed 
income or undistributed capital gains). This amount may not exceed, for more than 
two (2) consecutive Business Days, 0.5% of the value of the Portfolio. If the Trustee 
has made all required adjustments and is left with cash in excess of 0.5% of the value 
of the Portfolio, the Trustee will use such cash to purchase additional Index 
Securities. All portfolio adjustments are made as described herein unless such adjustments 
would cause the Trust to lose its status as a “regulated investment company” under 
Subchapter M of the Code. Additionally, the Trustee is required to adjust the 
composition of the Portfolio at any time to ensure the continued qualification of the 
Trust as a regulated investment company. The Trustee relies on S&P for information as to the composition and weightings of 
Index Securities.

composition of the Portfolio at any time to ensure the continued qualification of the 
Trust as a regulated investment company. The Trustee relies on S&P for information as to the composition and weightings of 
Index Securities. If the Trustee becomes incapable of obtaining or processing such 
information or NSCC is unable to receive such information from the Trustee on any 
Business Day, the Trustee shall use the composition and weightings of Index 
Securities for the most recently effective Portfolio Deposit for the purposes of all 
adjustments and determinations (including, without limitation, determination of the 
stock portion of the Portfolio Deposit) until the earlier of (a) such time as current 
information with respect to Index Securities is available or (b) three (3) consecutive 
Business Days have elapsed. If such current information is not available and three 
(3) consecutive Business Days have elapsed, the composition and weightings of 
Portfolio Securities (as opposed to Index Securities) shall be used for the purposes of 
all adjustments and determinations (including, without limitation, determination of 
the stock portion of the Portfolio Deposit) until current information with respect to 
Index Securities is available. If the Trustee provides written notice of the termination of the Trust, from and after 
the date of such notice, the Trustee shall use the composition and weightings of 
Portfolio Securities as of such notice date for the determination of all redemptions or 
other purposes. From time to time S&P may adjust the composition of the DJIA because of a merger 
or acquisition involving one or more Index Securities. In such cases, the Trust, as 
shareholder of an issuer that is the object of such merger or acquisition activity, may 
receive various offers from would-be acquirors of the issuer.

or acquisition involving one or more Index Securities. In such cases, the Trust, as 
shareholder of an issuer that is the object of such merger or acquisition activity, may 
receive various offers from would-be acquirors of the issuer. The Trustee is not 
permitted to accept any such offers until such time as it has been determined that the 
stocks of the issuer will be removed from the DJIA. As stocks of an issuer are often 
removed from the DJIA only after the consummation of a merger or acquisition of 
54 
such issuer, in selling the securities of such issuer, the Trust may receive, to the 
extent that market prices do not provide a more attractive alternative, whatever 
consideration is being offered to the shareholders of such issuer that have not 
tendered their shares prior to such time. Any cash received in such transactions is 
reinvested in Index Securities in accordance with the criteria set forth above. Any 
stocks received as a part of the consideration that are not Index Securities are sold as 
soon as practicable, and the cash proceeds of such sale are reinvested in accordance 
with the criteria set forth above. Adjustments to the Portfolio Deposit 
On each Business Day (each such day, an “Adjustment Day”), the number of shares 
and identity of each Index Security required for a Portfolio Deposit are adjusted in 
accordance with the following procedure. At the close of the market, the Trustee 
calculates the net asset value of the Trust. The net asset value of the Trust is divided 
by the number of outstanding Units multiplied by 50,000 Units in one Creation Unit, 
resulting in the net asset value per Creation Unit (“NAV Amount”).

calculates the net asset value of the Trust. The net asset value of the Trust is divided 
by the number of outstanding Units multiplied by 50,000 Units in one Creation Unit, 
resulting in the net asset value per Creation Unit (“NAV Amount”). The Trustee then 
calculates the number of shares (without rounding) of each of the component stocks 
of the DJIA in a Portfolio Deposit for the following Business Day (“Request Day”), 
such that (a) the market value at the close of the market on the Adjustment Day of the 
stocks to be included in the Portfolio Deposit on Request Day, together with the 
Dividend Equivalent Payment effective for requests to create or redeem on the 
Adjustment Day, equals the NAV Amount, and (b) the identity and weighting of each 
of the stocks in a Portfolio Deposit mirrors proportionately the identity and 
weightings of the stocks in the DJIA, each as in effect on Request Day. For each 
stock, the number resulting from such calculation is rounded down to the nearest 
whole share. The identities and weightings of the stocks so calculated constitute the 
stock portion of the Portfolio Deposit effective on Request Day and thereafter until 
the next subsequent Adjustment Day, as well as Portfolio Securities to be delivered 
by the Trustee in the event of request for redemption on the Request Day and 
thereafter until the following Adjustment Day. In addition to the foregoing adjustments, if a corporate action such as a stock split, 
stock dividend or reverse split occurs with respect to any Index Security that results 
in an adjustment to the DJIA divisor, the Portfolio Deposit shall be adjusted to take 
into account the corporate action in each case rounded to the nearest whole share.

corresponding adjustment to the Portfolio Deposit on the day prior to the day on 
which the change to the DJIA takes effect. On the Request Day and on each day that a request for the creation or redemption is 
deemed received, the Trustee calculates the market value of the stock portion of the 
Portfolio Deposit as in effect on the Request Day as of the close of the market and 
adds to that amount the Dividend Equivalent Payment effective for requests to create

calculates the NAV Amount, based on the close of the market on the Request Day. The difference between the NAV Amount so calculated and the Portfolio Deposit

the NAV Amount exceeds the Portfolio Deposit Amount), then with respect to 
creation, the Balancing Amount increases the Cash Component of the then-effective 
Portfolio Deposit transferred to the Trustee by the creator. With respect to

Secondary Trading on Exchanges 
The Units are listed for secondary trading on the Exchange, and individual Units may 
only be purchased and sold in the secondary market through a broker-dealer. The 
secondary markets are closed on weekends and also are generally closed on the 
following holidays: New Year’s Day, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Presidents’ 
56 
Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day (observed), Juneteenth National Independence 
Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. The 
Exchange may close early on the Business Day before certain holidays and on the 
day after Thanksgiving Day. Exchange holiday schedules are subject to change. If 
you buy or sell Units in the secondary market, you will pay the secondary market 
price for Units. In addition, you may incur customary brokerage commissions and 
charges and may pay some or all of the spread between the bid and the offered price 
in the secondary market on each leg of a round trip (purchase and sale) transaction. Further, SSGA FD may make payments from its own resources to certain broker-
dealers pursuant to arrangements through which those broker- dealers have agreed to 
offer Units to their customers and not charge certain of their customers any 
commissions when those customers purchase or sell Units. Such payments to broker-
dealers may create potential conflicts of interest between the broker-dealers and their 
customers. There can be no assurance that the requirements of the Exchange necessary to 
maintain the listing of Units of the Trust will continue to be met or that Units will 
always be listed on the Exchange. The Trust will be terminated if Units are delisted. Trading in Units may be halted under certain circumstances as set forth in the 
Exchange rules and procedures.

The Trust will be terminated if Units are delisted. Trading in Units may be halted under certain circumstances as set forth in the 
Exchange rules and procedures. The Exchange will consider the suspension of 
trading in or removal from listing of Units if: (a) the Trust has more than 60 days 
remaining until termination and there are fewer than 50 record and/or beneficial 
holders of Units for 30 or more consecutive trading days; (b) the value of the DJIA is 
no longer calculated or available; or (c) such other event occurs or condition exists 
which, in the opinion of the Exchange, makes further dealings on the Exchange 
inadvisable. In addition, trading is subject to trading halts caused by extraordinary 
market volatility pursuant to Exchange “circuit breaker” rules that require trading to 
be halted for a specified period based on a specified market change. The Exchange 
also must halt trading if required intraday valuation information is not disseminated 
for longer than one (1) Business Day. Units are also listed and traded on the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading 
Limited and Euronext Amsterdam. In the future, Units may be listed and traded on 
other non-U.S. exchanges. Euronext Amsterdam is an indirect wholly owned 
subsidiary of NYSE Holdings. Trading Prices of Units 
The trading prices of the Trust’s Units will fluctuate continuously throughout trading 
hours based on market supply and demand rather than the Trust’s NAV, which is 
calculated at the end of each Business Day. The Units will trade on the Exchange at 
prices that may be above (i.e., at a premium) or below (i.e., at a discount), to varying 
degrees, the daily NAV of the Units. While the creation/redemption feature is 
designed to make it likely that Units normally will trade close to the Trust’s NAV,

The Units will trade on the Exchange at 
prices that may be above (i.e., at a premium) or below (i.e., at a discount), to varying 
degrees, the daily NAV of the Units. While the creation/redemption feature is 
designed to make it likely that Units normally will trade close to the Trust’s NAV, 
disruptions to creations and redemptions and/or market volatility may result in 
trading prices that differ significantly from the Trust’s NAV. See the table 
57 
“Frequency Distribution of Discounts and Premiums for the Trust: Bid/Ask Price vs. 
NAV as of 12/31/24” herein. The market price of a Unit should reflect its share of the dividends accumulated on 
Portfolio Securities and may be affected by supply and demand, market volatility, 
sentiment and other factors. CONTINUOUS OFFERING OF UNITS 
Creation Units are offered continuously to the public by the Trust through the 
Distributor. Persons making Portfolio Deposits and creating Creation Units will 
receive no fees, commissions or other form of compensation or inducement of any 
kind from the Sponsor or the Distributor, and no such person has any obligation or 
responsibility to the Sponsor or Distributor to effect any sale or resale of Units. Because new Units can be created and issued on an ongoing basis, at any point during 
the life of the Trust, a “distribution,” as such term is used in the Securities Act of 
1933, may be occurring. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some of 
their activities may result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a 
manner which could render them statutory underwriters and subject them to the 
prospectus-delivery and liability provisions of the Securities Act of 1933.

manner which could render them statutory underwriters and subject them to the

example, a broker-dealer firm or its client may be deemed a statutory underwriter if it 
takes Creation Units after placing a creation order with a distributor, breaks them 
down into the constituent Units and sells the Units directly to its customers; or if it 
chooses to couple the creation of a supply of new Units with an active selling effort 
involving solicitation of secondary market demand for Units. A determination of 
whether one is an underwriter must take into account all the facts and circumstances 
pertaining to the activities of the broker-dealer or its client in the particular case, and 
the examples mentioned above should not be considered a complete description of all 
the activities that could lead to categorization as an underwriter. Broker-dealer firms should also note that dealers who are not “underwriters” but are 
effecting transactions in Units, whether or not participating in the distribution of 
Units, generally are required to deliver a prospectus. This is because the prospectus 
delivery exemption in Section 4(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 is not available in 
respect of such transactions as a result of Section 24(d) of the 1940 Act.

of the Securities Act of 1933. For delivery of prospectuses to exchange members, the 
prospectus delivery mechanism of Rule 153 under the Securities Act of 1933 is only 
available with respect to transactions on a national exchange. The Sponsor intends to qualify Units in states selected by the Sponsor and through 
broker-dealers who are members of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority

collectively referred to herein as “Portfolio Deposit Amount”). The Trustee then 
calculates the NAV Amount, based on the close of the market on the Request Day. The difference between the NAV Amount so calculated and the Portfolio Deposit 
Amount is the “Balancing Amount.” The Balancing Amount serves the function of 
compensating for any differences between the value of the Portfolio Deposit Amount 
and the NAV Amount at the close of trading on Request Day due to, for example, 
(a) differences in the market value of the securities in the Portfolio Deposit and the 
market value of the securities on Request Day and (b) any variances from the proper 
composition of the Portfolio Deposit. The Dividend Equivalent Payment and the Balancing Amount in effect at the close of 
business on the Request Date are collectively referred to as the Cash Component or 
the Cash Redemption Payment. If the Balancing Amount is a positive number (i.e., if 
the NAV Amount exceeds the Portfolio Deposit Amount), then with respect to 
creation, the Balancing Amount increases the Cash Component of the then-effective 
Portfolio Deposit transferred to the Trustee by the creator. With respect to 
redemptions, the Balancing Amount is added to the cash transferred to the redeemer 
by the Trustee. If the Balancing Amount is a negative number (i.e., if the NAV 
Amount is less than the Portfolio Deposit Amount), then with respect to creation, this 
amount decreases the Cash Component of the then-effective Portfolio Deposit to be 
transferred to the Trustee by the creator or, if such cash portion is less than the 
Balancing Amount, the difference must be paid by the Trustee to the creator. With 
respect to redemptions, the Balancing Amount is deducted from the cash transferred 
to the redeemer or, if such cash is less than the Balancing Amount, the difference 
must be paid by the redeemer to the Trustee.

Secondary Trading on Exchanges 
The Units are listed for secondary trading on the Exchange, and individual Units may 
only be purchased and sold in the secondary market through a broker-dealer. The 
secondary markets are closed on weekends and also are generally closed on the 
following holidays: New Year’s Day, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Presidents’

Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day (observed), Juneteenth National Independence 
Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. The 
Exchange may close early on the Business Day before certain holidays and on the 
day after Thanksgiving Day. Exchange holiday schedules are subject to change. If 
you buy or sell Units in the secondary market, you will pay the secondary market 
price for Units. In addition, you may incur customary brokerage commissions and 
charges and may pay some or all of the spread between the bid and the offered price 
in the secondary market on each leg of a round trip (purchase and sale) transaction. Further, SSGA FD may make payments from its own resources to certain broker-
dealers pursuant to arrangements through which those broker- dealers have agreed to 
offer Units to their customers and not charge certain of their customers any 
commissions when those customers purchase or sell Units. Such payments to broker-
dealers may create potential conflicts of interest between the broker-dealers and their 
customers. There can be no assurance that the requirements of the Exchange necessary to 
maintain the listing of Units of the Trust will continue to be met or that Units will 
always be listed on the Exchange. The Trust will be terminated if Units are delisted. Trading in Units may be halted under certain circumstances as set forth in the 
Exchange rules and procedures.

The Trust will be terminated if Units are delisted. Trading in Units may be halted under certain circumstances as set forth in the 
Exchange rules and procedures. The Exchange will consider the suspension of 
trading in or removal from listing of Units if: (a) the Trust has more than 60 days 
remaining until termination and there are fewer than 50 record and/or beneficial 
holders of Units for 30 or more consecutive trading days; (b) the value of the DJIA is 
no longer calculated or available; or (c) such other event occurs or condition exists 
which, in the opinion of the Exchange, makes further dealings on the Exchange 
inadvisable. In addition, trading is subject to trading halts caused by extraordinary 
market volatility pursuant to Exchange “circuit breaker” rules that require trading to 
be halted for a specified period based on a specified market change. The Exchange 
also must halt trading if required intraday valuation information is not disseminated 
for longer than one (1) Business Day. Units are also listed and traded on the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading 
Limited and Euronext Amsterdam. In the future, Units may be listed and traded on 
other non-U.S. exchanges. Euronext Amsterdam is an indirect wholly owned 
subsidiary of NYSE Holdings. Trading Prices of Units 
The trading prices of the Trust’s Units will fluctuate continuously throughout trading 
hours based on market supply and demand rather than the Trust’s NAV, which is 
calculated at the end of each Business Day. The Units will trade on the Exchange at 
prices that may be above (i.e., at a premium) or below (i.e., at a discount), to varying

involving a broker-dealer registered in such person’s state of domicile or residence 
should consult their legal adviser regarding applicable broker-dealer or securities 
regulatory requirements under the state securities laws prior to such creation or 
redemption. EXPENSES OF THE TRUST

rate of 0.16%. Future accruals will depend primarily on the level of the Trust’s net 
assets and the level of Trust expenses. There is no guarantee that the Trust’s ordinary 
operating expenses will not exceed 0.16% of the Trust’s daily net asset value, and 
such rate may be changed without notice.

entered into an agreement with SSGA FD, an affiliate of the Trustee, pursuant to 
which SSGA FD has agreed to market and promote the Trust. SSGA FD is 
reimbursed by the Sponsor for the expenses it incurs for providing such services out 
of amounts that the Trust reimburses the Sponsor. An affiliate of SSGA FD 
separately receives fees from the Trustee for providing on-line creation and 
redemption functionality to Authorized Participants through its Fund Connect 
application. If the income received by the Trust in the form of dividends and other distributions 
on Portfolio Securities is insufficient to cover Trust expenses, the Trustee may make 
advances to the Trust to cover such expenses. Otherwise, the Trustee may sell 
Portfolio Securities in an amount sufficient to pay such expenses. The Trustee may 
reimburse itself in the amount of any such advance, together with interest thereon at a 
percentage rate equal to the then-current overnight federal funds rate, by deducting 
such amounts from (a) dividend payments or other income of the Trust when such 
payments or other income are received, (b) the amounts earned or benefits derived by 
the Trustee on cash held by the Trustee for the benefit of the Trust, and (c) the sale of 
Portfolio Securities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any advance remains 
outstanding for more than forty-five (45) Business Days, the Trustee may sell 
Portfolio Securities to reimburse itself for such advance and any accrued interest 
thereon. These advances will be secured by a lien on the assets of the Trust in favor

thereon. These advances will be secured by a lien on the assets of the Trust in favor

annual rate of 0.06% to 0.10% of the net asset value of the Trust, as shown below, 
depending on the net asset value of the Trust, plus or minus the Adjustment Amount 
(as defined below). The compensation is computed on each Business Day based on 
the net asset value of the Trust on such day, and the amount thereof is accrued daily 
and paid quarterly. To the extent that the amount of the Trustee’s compensation, 
before any adjustment in respect of the Adjustment Amount, is less than specified 
amounts, the Sponsor has agreed to pay the amount of any such shortfall. Notwithstanding the fee schedule set forth in the table below, in the fourth year of the 
Trust’s operation and in subsequent years, the Trustee shall be paid a minimum fee of 
$400,000 per annum as adjusted by the CPI-U to take effect at the beginning of the 
fourth year and each year thereafter. The Trustee also may waive all or a portion of

as to the actual net asset value of the Trust on any future date, as it is subject to 
change at any time due to fluctuations in the market value of the Portfolio Securities, 
or to creations or redemptions made in the future. For the fiscal year ended 
October 31, 2024, the aggregate dollar amount of fees paid to the Trustee was 
$17,048,719.85. The Adjustment Amount is calculated at the end of each quarter and applied against 
the Trustee’s fee for the following quarter. “Adjustment Amount” is an amount 
which is intended, depending upon the circumstances, either to (a) reduce the 
Trustee’s fee by the amount that the Transaction Fees paid on creation and 
redemption exceed the costs of those activities, and by the amount of excess earnings 
on cash held for the benefit of the Trust** or (b) increase the Trustee’s fee by the 
amount that the Transaction Fees (plus additional amounts paid in connection with 
creations or redemptions outside the Clearing Process), paid on creations or 
redemptions, falls short of the actual costs of these activities. If in any quarter the 
Adjustment Amount exceeds the fee payable to the Trustee as set forth above, the 
Trustee uses such excess amount to reduce other Trust expenses, subject to certain 
federal tax limitations. To the extent that the amount of such excess exceeds the 
Trust’s expenses for such quarter, any remaining excess is retained by the Trustee as 
part of its compensation.

Trustee uses such excess amount to reduce other Trust expenses, subject to certain 
federal tax limitations. To the extent that the amount of such excess exceeds the 
Trust’s expenses for such quarter, any remaining excess is retained by the Trustee as

redemptions exceed the amounts charged as a Transaction Fee (plus the additional 
amounts paid in connection with creations or redemptions outside the Clearing 
Process) net of the excess earnings, if any, on cash held for the benefit of the Trust, 
the Trustee will augment the Trustee’s fee by the resulting Adjustment Amount. The 
net Adjustment Amount is usually a credit to the Trust. The amount of the earnings 
credit will be equal to the then-current Federal Funds Rate, as reported in nationally 
distributed publications, multiplied by each day’s daily cash balance in the Trust’s 
cash account, reduced by the amount of reserves for that account required by the 
Federal Reserve Board of Governors. For example, during the year ended October 31, 2024, the Adjustment Amount 
included an excess of net transaction fees from processing orders of $850,473 and a 
Trustee earnings credit of $2,547,808. Thus, the Adjustment Amount reduced the 
Trustee’s fee by $3,398,281. DETERMINATION OF NET ASSET VALUE 
The net asset value of the Trust is computed as of the Evaluation Time, as shown 
under “Portfolio Adjustments — Adjustments to the Portfolio Deposit” on each 
Business Day. The net asset value of the Trust on a per Unit basis is determined by

federal tax limitations. To the extent that the amount of such excess exceeds the 
Trust’s expenses for such quarter, any remaining excess is retained by the Trustee as 
part of its compensation. If in any quarter the costs of processing creations and 
redemptions exceed the amounts charged as a Transaction Fee (plus the additional 
amounts paid in connection with creations or redemptions outside the Clearing 
Process) net of the excess earnings, if any, on cash held for the benefit of the Trust, 
the Trustee will augment the Trustee’s fee by the resulting Adjustment Amount. The 
net Adjustment Amount is usually a credit to the Trust. The amount of the earnings 
credit will be equal to the then-current Federal Funds Rate, as reported in nationally 
distributed publications, multiplied by each day’s daily cash balance in the Trust’s 
cash account, reduced by the amount of reserves for that account required by the 
Federal Reserve Board of Governors. For example, during the year ended October 31, 2024, the Adjustment Amount 
included an excess of net transaction fees from processing orders of $850,473 and a 
Trustee earnings credit of $2,547,808. Thus, the Adjustment Amount reduced the 
Trustee’s fee by $3,398,281. DETERMINATION OF NET ASSET VALUE

As of October 31, 2024, and as of December 31, 2024, the net asset value of the Trust 
was $35,434,158,404 and $37,403,354,698, respectively. No representation is made 
as to the actual net asset value of the Trust on any future date, as it is subject to 
change at any time due to fluctuations in the market value of the Portfolio Securities, 
or to creations or redemptions made in the future. For the fiscal year ended 
October 31, 2024, the aggregate dollar amount of fees paid to the Trustee was 
$17,048,719.85. The Adjustment Amount is calculated at the end of each quarter and applied against 
the Trustee’s fee for the following quarter. “Adjustment Amount” is an amount 
which is intended, depending upon the circumstances, either to (a) reduce the 
Trustee’s fee by the amount that the Transaction Fees paid on creation and 
redemption exceed the costs of those activities, and by the amount of excess earnings 
on cash held for the benefit of the Trust** or (b) increase the Trustee’s fee by the 
amount that the Transaction Fees (plus additional amounts paid in connection with 
creations or redemptions outside the Clearing Process), paid on creations or 
redemptions, falls short of the actual costs of these activities. If in any quarter the 
Adjustment Amount exceeds the fee payable to the Trustee as set forth above, the 
Trustee uses such excess amount to reduce other Trust expenses, subject to certain 
federal tax limitations. To the extent that the amount of such excess exceeds the 
Trust’s expenses for such quarter, any remaining excess is retained by the Trustee as 
part of its compensation. If in any quarter the costs of processing creations and 
redemptions exceed the amounts charged as a Transaction Fee (plus the additional 
amounts paid in connection with creations or redemptions outside the Clearing 
Process) net of the excess earnings, if any, on cash held for the benefit of the Trust, 
the Trustee will augment the Trustee’s fee by the resulting Adjustment Amount.

For the most recent net asset value information, please 
go to www.spdrs.com. The value of the Portfolio is determined by the Trustee in good faith in the following 
manner. If Portfolio Securities are listed on one or more national securities 
exchanges, such evaluation is generally based on the closing sale price on that day 
(unless the Trustee deems such price inappropriate as a basis for evaluation) on the 
exchange which is deemed to be the principal market therefor or, if there is no such 
appropriate closing sale price on such exchange, at the last sale price (unless the 
Trustee deems such price inappropriate as a basis for evaluation). If the securities are 
not so listed or, if so listed and the principal market therefor is other than on such 
exchange or there is no such last sale price available, such evaluation shall generally 
be made by the Trustee in good faith based on the closing price on the over-the-
counter market (unless the Trustee deems such price inappropriate as a basis for 
evaluation) or if there is no such appropriate closing price, (a) on current bid prices, 
(b) if bid prices are not available, on the basis of current bid prices for comparable 
securities, (c) by the Trustee’s appraising the value of the securities in good faith on 
the bid side of the market, or (d) by any combination thereof. ADDITIONAL RISK INFORMATION The following section identifies additional risks. Prospective investors should 
carefully consider the additional information described below together with the 
information identified under “Summary — Principal Risks of Investing in the Trust.” A liquid trading market for certain Portfolio Securities may not exist. Although all 
of the Portfolio Securities are listed on a national securities exchange, the existence 
of a liquid trading market for certain Portfolio Securities may depend on whether 
dealers will make a market in such stocks.

In addition, trading in Units on the Exchange is subject to trading halts

62 
rules. There can be no assurance that the requirements of the Exchange necessary to 
maintain the listing of the Trust will continue to be met or will remain unchanged or 
that the Units will trade with any volume, or at all, on any stock exchange. Investors 
are subject to the execution and settlement risks and market standards of the market 
where they or their broker direct their trades for execution. The Trust will be 
terminated if the Units are delisted from the Exchange. Fluctuation of NAV; Unit Premiums and Discounts. The NAV of the Units will 
generally fluctuate with changes in the market value of the Trust’s securities 
holdings. The market prices of Units will generally fluctuate in accordance with 
changes in the Trust’s NAV and supply and demand of Units on the Exchange or any 
other exchange on which Units are traded. It cannot be predicted whether Units will 
trade below, at or above their NAV. Price differences may be due, in large part, to the 
fact that supply and demand forces at work in the secondary trading market for Units 
will be closely related to, but not identical to, the same forces influencing the prices 
of the securities of the DJIA trading individually or in the aggregate at any point in 
time. The market prices of Units may deviate significantly from the NAV of the 
Units during periods of market volatility. While the creation/redemption feature is 
designed to make it likely that Units normally will trade close to the Trust’s NAV, 
disruptions to creations and redemptions and/or market volatility may result in 
trading prices that differ significantly from the Trust’s NAV.

The market prices of Units may deviate significantly from the NAV of the 
Units during periods of market volatility. While the creation/redemption feature is 
designed to make it likely that Units normally will trade close to the Trust’s NAV, 
disruptions to creations and redemptions and/or market volatility may result in 
trading prices that differ significantly from the Trust’s NAV. If an investor purchases 
Units at a time when the market price is at a premium to the NAV of the Units or 
sells at a time when the market price is at a discount to the NAV of the Units, then 
the investor may sustain losses that are in addition to any losses caused by a decrease 
in NAV.  
Costs of Buying or Selling Units. Investors buying or selling Units in the secondary 
market will pay brokerage commissions or other charges imposed by brokers as 
determined by that broker. Brokerage commissions are often a fixed amount and may 
be a significant proportional cost for investors seeking to buy or sell relatively small 
amounts of Units. In addition, secondary market investors will also incur the cost of 
the difference between the price that an investor is willing to pay for Units (the “bid” 
price) and the price at which an investor is willing to sell Units (the “ask” price). This 
difference in bid and ask prices is often referred to as the “spread” or “bid/ask 
spread.” The bid/ask spread varies over time for Units based on trading volume and 
market liquidity, and is generally lower if the Trust’s Units have more trading 
volume and market liquidity and higher if the Trust’s Units have little trading volume 
and market liquidity. Further, increased market volatility may cause increased bid/ask 
spreads. Due to the costs of buying or selling Units, including bid/ask spreads, 
frequent trading of Units may significantly reduce investment results, and an 
investment in Units may not be advisable for investors who anticipate regularly 
making small investments. Large Cap Risk.

U.S. companies could trail the returns on investments in stocks of smaller and mid-
sized companies. Additionally, Units may perform differently from other investments in portfolios 
containing large-capitalization stocks based upon or derived from an index other than 
the DJIA. For example, the great majority of component stocks of the DJIA are 
drawn from among the largest of the large-capitalization universe, while other 
indexes may represent a broader sampling of stocks within capitalization ranges. Large-capitalization companies usually cannot respond as quickly as smaller 
companies to competitive challenges, and their growth rates tend to lag the growth 
rates of well-managed smaller companies during strong economic periods. Also, 
other indexes may use different methods for assigning relative weights to the index 
components than the price-weighted method used by the DJIA. As a result, DJIA 
accords relatively more weight to stocks with a higher price-to-market capitalization 
ratio than a similar market capitalization-weighted index. Investment in the Trust may have adverse tax consequences. Investors in the Trust 
should consider the U.S. federal, state, local and other tax consequences of the 
ownership and disposition of Units. For a discussion of certain U.S. federal income 
tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of Units, see “Federal Income 
Taxes.” Clearing and settlement of Creation Units may be delayed or fail.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING DIVIDENDS AND 
DISTRIBUTIONS The following information supplements and should be read in conjunction with the 
section included in this prospectus entitled “Dividends and Distributions.” General Policies 
The regular monthly ex-dividend date for Units is the third (3rd) Friday in each 
calendar month, unless such day is not a Business Day, in which case the ex-dividend 
date is the immediately preceding Business Day (“Ex-Dividend Date”). Beneficial 
Owners reflected on the records of DTC and the DTC Participants on the Ex-

representing dividends accumulated on Portfolio Securities through the monthly 
dividend period which ends on the Business Day preceding such Ex-Dividend Date 
(including stocks with ex-dividend dates falling within such monthly dividend 
period), net of fees and expenses, accrued daily for such period. 64 For the purposes of all dividend distributions, dividends per Unit are calculated at 
least to the nearest 1/1000th of $0.01. The payment of dividends is made on the 
Monday preceding the third (3rd) Friday of the next calendar month or the next 
subsequent day if such Monday is not a Business Day or is a Business Day when the 
U.S. Federal Reserve is not open (“Dividend Payment Date”). Dividend payments are 
made through DTC and the DTC Participants to Beneficial Owners then of record 
with funds received from the Trustee. Dividends payable to the Trust in respect of Portfolio Securities are credited by the 
Trustee to a non-interest-bearing account as of the date on which the Trust receives 
such dividends.

the provisions of the Trust Agreement. To the extent the amounts credited to the 
account generate interest income or an equivalent benefit to the Trustee, such interest 
income or benefit is used to reduce the Trustee’s annual fee. Any additional distributions the Trust may need to make so as to qualify for an 
exemption from tax on its distributed income under the Code and to avoid U.S. 
federal excise tax would consist of (a) an increase in the distribution scheduled for 
January to include any amount by which the Trust’s estimated “investment company 
taxable income” (determined prior to the deduction for dividends paid by the Trust) 
and net capital gains for the prior taxable and/or calendar year exceeded the amount 
of Trust taxable income previously distributed with respect to such taxable year and/
or calendar year or, if greater, the minimum amount required to avoid imposition of 
such excise tax and (b) a distribution soon after the computation of the actual annual 
“investment company taxable income” (determined prior to the deduction for 
dividends paid by the Trust) and net capital gain of the Trust of the amount, if any, by 
which such actual income and gain exceeds the distributions already made. The net 
asset value of the Trust is reduced in direct proportion to the amount of such 
additional distributions. The magnitude of the additional distributions, if any, 
depends upon a number of factors, including the level of redemption activity 
experienced by the Trust. Because substantially all proceeds from the sale of stocks 
in connection with adjustments to the Portfolio are used to purchase shares of Index 
Securities, the Trust may have no cash or insufficient cash with which to pay such 
additional distributions.

The magnitude of the additional distributions, if any, 
depends upon a number of factors, including the level of redemption activity 
experienced by the Trust. Because substantially all proceeds from the sale of stocks 
in connection with adjustments to the Portfolio are used to purchase shares of Index 
Securities, the Trust may have no cash or insufficient cash with which to pay such 
additional distributions. In that case, the Trustee typically will have to sell an 
approximately equal number of shares of each of the Portfolio Securities sufficient to 
produce the cash required to make such additional distributions. The Trustee may declare special dividends if such action is necessary or advisable to 
preserve the status of the Trust as a RIC or to avoid imposition of income or excise 
taxes on undistributed income. In addition, the Trust may vary the frequency with 
65 
which periodic distributions are made (e.g., from monthly to quarterly) if it is 
determined by the Sponsor and the Trustee that such a variance would be advisable to 
facilitate compliance with the rules and regulations applicable to RICs or would 
otherwise be advantageous to the Trust. The Trustee may also change the regular ex-
dividend date for Units to another date within the month or the quarter if the Sponsor 
and the Trustee determine that such a change would be advantageous to the Trust. Notice of any such variance or change will be provided to Beneficial Owners via 
DTC and the DTC Participants. All distributions are made by the Trustee through DTC and the DTC Participants to 
Beneficial Owners as recorded on the book entry system of DTC and the DTC 
Participants. With each distribution, the Trustee furnishes for distribution to 
Beneficial Owners a statement setting forth the amount being distributed, expressed 
as a dollar amount per Unit.

All distributions are made by the Trustee through DTC and the DTC Participants to 
Beneficial Owners as recorded on the book entry system of DTC and the DTC 
Participants. With each distribution, the Trustee furnishes for distribution to 
Beneficial Owners a statement setting forth the amount being distributed, expressed 
as a dollar amount per Unit. The settlement date for the creation of Units or the purchase of Units in the secondary 
market must occur on or before the Record Date in order for such creator or 
purchaser to receive a distribution on the next Dividend Payment Date. If the 
settlement date for such creation or a secondary market purchase occurs after the 
Record Date, the distribution will be made to the prior securityholder or Beneficial 
Owner as of such Record Date. As soon as practicable after notice of termination of the Trust, the Trustee will 
distribute via DTC and the DTC Participants to each Beneficial Owner redeeming 
Creation Units before the termination date specified in such notice a portion of 
Portfolio Securities and cash as described above. Otherwise, the Trustee will 
distribute to each Beneficial Owner (whether in Creation Unit size aggregations or 
otherwise), as soon as practicable after termination of the Trust, such Beneficial 
Owner’s pro rata share of the net asset value of the Trust. INVESTMENT RESTRICTIONS 
The Trust is not actively managed and only holds constituent securities of the Index 
regardless of the current or projected performance of a specific security or a 
particular industry or market sector.

The Trust is not actively managed and only holds constituent securities of the Index 
regardless of the current or projected performance of a specific security or a

the securities of registered investment companies or any other registered or 
unregistered funds, lend its portfolio securities or other assets, issue senior securities 
or borrow money for the purpose of investing in securities, purchase securities on 
margin, sell securities short or invest in derivative instruments, including, without 
limitation, futures contracts, options or swaps. INVESTMENTS BY INVESTMENT COMPANIES 
Purchases of Units by investment companies and certain private funds are subject to 
restrictions pursuant to Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act. However, SEC Rule 12d1-4 
allows, subject to certain conditions (including the entry into an agreement with the

U.S. companies could trail the returns on investments in stocks of smaller and mid-
sized companies. Additionally, Units may perform differently from other investments in portfolios 
containing large-capitalization stocks based upon or derived from an index other than 
the DJIA. For example, the great majority of component stocks of the DJIA are 
drawn from among the largest of the large-capitalization universe, while other 
indexes may represent a broader sampling of stocks within capitalization ranges. Large-capitalization companies usually cannot respond as quickly as smaller 
companies to competitive challenges, and their growth rates tend to lag the growth 
rates of well-managed smaller companies during strong economic periods. Also, 
other indexes may use different methods for assigning relative weights to the index 
components than the price-weighted method used by the DJIA. As a result, DJIA 
accords relatively more weight to stocks with a higher price-to-market capitalization 
ratio than a similar market capitalization-weighted index. Investment in the Trust may have adverse tax consequences. Investors in the Trust 
should consider the U.S. federal, state, local and other tax consequences of the 
ownership and disposition of Units. For a discussion of certain U.S. federal income 
tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of Units, see “Federal Income 
Taxes.” Clearing and settlement of Creation Units may be delayed or fail. Even if an order 
is processed through the continuous net settlement clearing process of NSCC, 
Portfolio Securities or Units, as applicable, may not be delivered on settlement date, 
due to liquidity or other constraints in the clearing process. Orders expected to settle 
outside of the continuous net settlement clearing process of NSCC are not covered by 
NSCC’s guarantee of completion of delivery. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING DIVIDENDS AND

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING DIVIDENDS AND 
DISTRIBUTIONS The following information supplements and should be read in conjunction with the 
section included in this prospectus entitled “Dividends and Distributions.” General Policies 
The regular monthly ex-dividend date for Units is the third (3rd) Friday in each 
calendar month, unless such day is not a Business Day, in which case the ex-dividend 
date is the immediately preceding Business Day (“Ex-Dividend Date”). Beneficial 
Owners reflected on the records of DTC and the DTC Participants on the Ex-
Dividend Date (also, the “Record Date”) are entitled to receive an amount 
representing dividends accumulated on Portfolio Securities through the monthly 
dividend period which ends on the Business Day preceding such Ex-Dividend Date 
(including stocks with ex-dividend dates falling within such monthly dividend 
period), net of fees and expenses, accrued daily for such period. 64 For the purposes of all dividend distributions, dividends per Unit are calculated at 
least to the nearest 1/1000th of $0.01. The payment of dividends is made on the 
Monday preceding the third (3rd) Friday of the next calendar month or the next 
subsequent day if such Monday is not a Business Day or is a Business Day when the 
U.S. Federal Reserve is not open (“Dividend Payment Date”). Dividend payments are 
made through DTC and the DTC Participants to Beneficial Owners then of record 
with funds received from the Trustee. Dividends payable to the Trust in respect of Portfolio Securities are credited by the 
Trustee to a non-interest-bearing account as of the date on which the Trust receives 
such dividends.

including but not limited to the Cash Component, the Cash Redemption Payment, all 
moneys realized by the Trustee from the sale of options, warrants or other similar 
rights received or distributed in respect of Portfolio Securities as dividends or 
distributions and capital gains resulting from the sale of Portfolio Securities are 
credited by the Trustee to a non-interest-bearing account. All funds collected or 
received are held by the Trustee without interest until distributed in accordance with 
the provisions of the Trust Agreement. To the extent the amounts credited to the 
account generate interest income or an equivalent benefit to the Trustee, such interest 
income or benefit is used to reduce the Trustee’s annual fee.

account generate interest income or an equivalent benefit to the Trustee, such interest 
income or benefit is used to reduce the Trustee’s annual fee. Any additional distributions the Trust may need to make so as to qualify for an 
exemption from tax on its distributed income under the Code and to avoid U.S. 
federal excise tax would consist of (a) an increase in the distribution scheduled for 
January to include any amount by which the Trust’s estimated “investment company 
taxable income” (determined prior to the deduction for dividends paid by the Trust) 
and net capital gains for the prior taxable and/or calendar year exceeded the amount 
of Trust taxable income previously distributed with respect to such taxable year and/
or calendar year or, if greater, the minimum amount required to avoid imposition of 
such excise tax and (b) a distribution soon after the computation of the actual annual 
“investment company taxable income” (determined prior to the deduction for 
dividends paid by the Trust) and net capital gain of the Trust of the amount, if any, by 
which such actual income and gain exceeds the distributions already made. The net 
asset value of the Trust is reduced in direct proportion to the amount of such 
additional distributions. The magnitude of the additional distributions, if any, 
depends upon a number of factors, including the level of redemption activity 
experienced by the Trust. Because substantially all proceeds from the sale of stocks 
in connection with adjustments to the Portfolio are used to purchase shares of Index 
Securities, the Trust may have no cash or insufficient cash with which to pay such

notwithstanding the investment restrictions described above, absent an exemption or 
SEC relief, (a) the Trust cannot invest in any registered investment company, to the 
extent that the Trust would own more than 3% of that registered investment 
company’s outstanding Units, (b) the Trust cannot invest more than 5% of its total 
assets in the securities of any one registered investment company, and (c) the Trust 
cannot invest more than 10% of its total assets in the securities of registered 
investment companies in the aggregate. ANNUAL REPORTS 
Promptly after the end of each fiscal year, the Trustee furnishes to the DTC 
Participants for distribution to each person who was a Beneficial Owner of Units at 
the end of such fiscal year, an annual report of the Trust containing financial 
statements audited by independent accountants of nationally recognized standing and 
such other information as may be required by applicable laws, rules and regulations. BENEFIT PLAN INVESTOR CONSIDERATIONS

ANNUAL REPORTS 
Promptly after the end of each fiscal year, the Trustee furnishes to the DTC 
Participants for distribution to each person who was a Beneficial Owner of Units at 
the end of such fiscal year, an annual report of the Trust containing financial 
statements audited by independent accountants of nationally recognized standing and 
such other information as may be required by applicable laws, rules and regulations. BENEFIT PLAN INVESTOR CONSIDERATIONS In considering the advisability of an investment in Units, fiduciaries of pension, 
profit-sharing or other tax-qualified retirement plans and funded welfare plans or 
entities whose underlying assets include “plan assets” within the meaning of the 
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”) 
(collectively, “Plans”) subject to the fiduciary responsibility requirements of ERISA, 
should consider whether an investment in Units (a) is permitted by the documents 
and instruments governing the Plan, (b) is made solely in the interest of participants 
and beneficiaries of the Plans, (c) is consistent with the prudence and diversification 
requirements of ERISA, and that the acquisition and holding of Units does not result 
in a non-exempt “prohibited transaction” under Section 406 of ERISA or 
Section 4975 of the Code. Individual retirement account (“IRA”) investors and 
certain other investors not subject to ERISA, such as Keogh Plans, should consider 
that such arrangements may make only such investments as are authorized by the 
governing instruments and that IRAs, Keogh Plans and certain other types of 
arrangements are subject to the prohibited transaction rules of Section 4975 of the 
Code. Employee benefit plans that are government plans (as defined in Section 3(32) 
of ERISA), certain church plans (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA) and non-U.S. 
plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA) are not subject to the requirements 
of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code.

On October 1, 2008, the Sponsor became an indirect, wholly 
owned subsidiary of NYSE Holdings following the acquisition by NYSE Holdings of 
the American Stock Exchange LLC and all of its subsidiaries. On November 13, 
2013, the Sponsor became an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Intercontinental 
Exchange, Inc. (“ICE”), following the acquisition of NYSE Holdings LLC (the 
parent company of the Sponsor) by ICE. As the parent company, ICE is the publicly 
traded entity, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “ICE.” NYSE Holdings is a “control person” of the Sponsor as such term is defined in the 
Securities Act of 1933. The Sponsor, at its own expense, may from time to time provide additional 
promotional incentives to brokers who sell Units to the public. In certain instances, 
these incentives may be provided only to those brokers who meet certain threshold 
requirements for participation in a given incentive program, such as selling a 
significant number of Units within a specified period. If at any time the Sponsor fails to undertake or perform or becomes incapable of 
undertaking or performing any of the duties which by the terms of the Trust 
Agreement are required to be undertaken or performed by it, and such failure is not 
cured within fifteen (15) Business Days following receipt of notice from the Trustee 
of such failure, or if the Sponsor resigns, or if the Sponsor is adjudged bankrupt or 
insolvent, or a receiver of the Sponsor or of its property is appointed, or a trustee or 
liquidator or any public officer takes charge or control of the Sponsor or of its 
70 
property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation, the 
Trustee may appoint a successor Sponsor, agree to act as Sponsor itself, or terminate 
the Trust Agreement and liquidate the Trust.

Sponsor’s execution of an instrument of appointment and assumption, the successor 
Sponsor succeeds to all of the rights, powers, duties and obligations of the original 
Sponsor. The successor Sponsor shall not be under any liability under the Trust 
Agreement for occurrences or omissions prior to the execution of such instrument. Any successor Sponsor may be compensated at rates deemed by the Trustee to be 
reasonable, but not exceeding the amounts prescribed by the SEC. The Sponsor may resign by executing and delivering to the Trustee an instrument of 
resignation. Such resignation shall become effective upon the appointment of a 
successor Sponsor and the acceptance of appointment by the successor Sponsor, 
unless the Trustee either agrees to act as Sponsor or terminates the Trust Agreement 
and liquidates the Trust.

successor Sponsor and the acceptance of appointment by the successor Sponsor,

resignation was delivered by the Sponsor, a successor Sponsor has not been 
appointed or the Trustee has not agreed to act as Sponsor. The Trust Agreement provides that the Sponsor is not liable to the Trustee, the Trust 
or to the Beneficial Owners of Units for taking or refraining from taking any action in 
good faith, or for errors in judgment, but is liable only for its own gross negligence, 
bad faith, willful misconduct or willful malfeasance in the performance of its duties 
or its reckless disregard of its obligations and duties under the Trust Agreement. The 
Sponsor is not liable or responsible in any way for depreciation or loss incurred by 
the Trust because of the purchase or sale of any Portfolio Securities. The 
Trust Agreement further provides that the Sponsor and its directors, shareholders, 
officers, employees, subsidiaries and affiliates under common control with the 
Sponsor shall be indemnified from the assets of the Trust and held harmless against 
any loss, liability or expense incurred without gross negligence, bad faith, willful 
misconduct or willful malfeasance on the part of any such party arising out of or in

Units are delisted from the Exchange. The Trust is scheduled to terminate on the first 
to occur of (a) January 14, 2123 or (b) the date 20 years after the death of the last 
survivor of fifteen persons named in the Trust Agreement, the oldest of whom was 
born in 1994 and the youngest of whom was born in 1997. The Trust will terminate if either the Sponsor or the Trustee resigns and a successor 
is not appointed. The Trust will also terminate if the Trustee is removed or the 
Sponsor fails to undertake or perform or becomes incapable of undertaking or 
performing any of the duties required under the Trust Agreement and a successor is 
not appointed. The dissolution of the Sponsor or its ceasing to exist as a legal entity 
for any cause whatsoever, however, will not cause the termination of the Trust 
Agreement or the Trust unless the Trust is terminated as described above. 80 
Prior written notice of the termination of the Trust must be given at least twenty

Prior written notice of the termination of the Trust must be given at least twenty 
(20) days before termination of the Trust to all Beneficial Owners. The notice must 
set forth the date on which the Trust will be terminated, the period during which the 
assets of the Trust will be liquidated, the date on which Beneficial Owners of Units 
(whether in Creation Unit size aggregations or otherwise) will receive in cash the 
NAV of the Units held, and the date upon which the books of the Trust shall be 
closed. The notice shall further state that, as of the date thereof and thereafter, neither 
requests to create additional Creation Units nor Portfolio Deposits will be accepted, 
and that, as of the date thereof, the portfolio of stocks delivered upon redemption 
shall be identical in composition and weighting to Portfolio Securities as of such date 
rather than the stock portion of the Portfolio Deposit as in effect on the date request 
for redemption is deemed received. Beneficial Owners of Creation Units may, in 
advance of the Termination Date, redeem in kind directly from the Trust. Within a reasonable period after the Termination Date, the Trustee shall, subject to 
any applicable provisions of law, sell all of the Portfolio Securities not already 
distributed to redeeming Beneficial Owners of Creation Units. The Trustee shall not 
be liable or responsible in any way for depreciation or loss incurred because of any 
such sale. The Trustee may suspend such sales upon the occurrence of unusual or 
unforeseen circumstances, including but not limited to a suspension in trading of a 
stock, the closing or restriction of trading on a stock exchange, the outbreak of 
hostilities or the collapse of the economy. The Trustee shall deduct from the proceeds 
of sale its fees and all other expenses and transmit the remaining amount to DTC for 
distribution, together with a final statement setting forth the computation of the gross 
amount distributed.

CODE OF ETHICS 
The Trust has adopted a code of ethics in compliance with Rule 17j-1 requirements 
under the 1940 Act. Subject to pre-clearance, reporting, certification and other 
conditions and standards, the code permits personnel subject to the code, if any, to 
invest in Index Securities for their own accounts. The code is designed to prevent 
fraud, deception and misconduct against the Trust and to provide reasonable 
standards of conduct. The code is on file with the SEC and available on the SEC’s 
Internet site at http://www.sec.gov. A copy may be obtained, after paying a 
duplicating fee, by electronic request at publicinfo@sec.gov. 
INFORMATION AND COMPARISONS RELATING TO 
SECONDARY MARKET TRADING AND PERFORMANCE One important difference between Units and conventional mutual fund shares is that 
Units are available for purchase or sale on an intraday basis on the Exchange at 
market prices. In contrast, shares in a conventional mutual fund may be purchased or 
redeemed only at a price at, or related to, the closing net asset value per share, as 
determined by the fund. The table below illustrates the distribution relationship of 
bid/ask spreads to NAV for 2024. This table should help investors evaluate some of 
the advantages and disadvantages of Units relative to mutual fund shares purchased 
and redeemed at prices at, or related to, the closing net asset value per share. Specifically, the table illustrates in an approximate way the risks of purchasing or 
selling Units at prices less favorable than closing NAV and, correspondingly, the 
opportunities to purchase or sell at prices more favorable than closing NAV. For the most recent information regarding the Trust’s NAV, market price, premiums 
and discounts, and bid/ask spreads, please go to www.spdrs.com. 82
